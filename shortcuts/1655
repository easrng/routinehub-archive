This eliminates the need to carefully select the phone number and launch the phone app. </p>\n<p>For Google Voice, you will have to paste the number into the dialer until I find a way to do that automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Note, obviously you can use this without Google Voice on any iPhone.</strong></p>\n<h1>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h1>\n<p>This shortcut has an integrated update mechanism called  <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\">Embed-a-Update</a>. Thanks to the embedded updater, it does not require any external updater shortcut. The shortcut checks for updates itself, so you'll never miss an update and it is super fast. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cpBjhE3_d.webp?maxwidth=1000&amp;fidelity=large\"></a>\n</p><p></p><p></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.1.1 - Jan. 16, 2020, 6:30 p.m.</strong></p><p>Added FaceTime option</p>"}
