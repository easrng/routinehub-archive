It works by using k- anonymity, hashing the password and then only sending the fist 5 characters of the hash to pwnedpasswords.com. Pwnedpasswords then sends you back a list of all possible matching password hashes back to your device so any matching strings can be detected locally. This way your password is never sent to anyone. </p>\n<p>See this Computerphile video for more information: </p>\n<p>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hhUb5iknVJs</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1 - March 13, 2019, 1:37 a.m.</strong></p>"}
