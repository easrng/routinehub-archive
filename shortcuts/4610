Not only that, it gives a helpful name for your custom-culinarily creation. This is <strong>by far</strong> the most useless shortcut I’ve ever made, but I hope you enjoy it for what it is! Happy forging!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n\n<h4>If You’ve Never Installed a Shortcut Before</h4>\n\n<p>Make sure you have the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752\">Shortcuts app</a> installed on your device and are running the required iOS for this Shortcut (check what iOS is required on the “<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4610/changelog\">Version History</a>” page for this shortcut). After that, head over to the Shortcuts section in the Settings app on your device and make sure the “Allow Untrusted Shortcuts” setting (under “SHARING SECURITY”) is set to enabled. Once that setting is enabled, follow the steps under the “If You’ve Installed a Shortcut in the Past” section below.\n<strong>If you are not able to enable that setting</strong> at the moment, open the Shortcuts app and, at the bottom, press the icon labeled “Gallery”. Once in the gallery, choose one of the pre-made shortcuts to install, press it, press “Add Shortcut”, and then go to the “My Shortcuts” page and run the shortcut you just installed. Then try enabling the “Allow Untrusted Shortcuts” setting again.</p>\n\n<h4>If You’ve Installed a Shortcut in the Past</h4>\n\n<p>Click the “Get Shortcut” button near <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4610/\">the top of this page</a>, scroll to the bottom of the window that opens in the Shortcuts app titled “Add Shortcut”, and then press the “Add Untrusted Shortcut” button.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>How to Use</h3>\n\n<h4>How to Begin</h4>\n\n<p>Once you’ve installed [the sandwich forge], you can launch it up by tapping on it in the Shortcuts app. Upon launching, you’ll see multiple lists popup, each with options of what emojis you can select to go on your final sandwich. For lists where you are able to select multiple items, you will have to press “Done” once you have selected your desired items (if there are any). For all other lists, you will only need to tap your desired option and [the sandwich forge] will move on to the next list automatically. Look to the chart below to see a list of all the lists.</p>\n\n<h4>The Lists (in order of appearance)</h4>\n\n<table>\n\n<thead>\n<tr>\n    <th>List Name</th>\n    <th>Select Multiple?</th>\n    <th>Emojis Currently Available in List</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n    <td>Breads</td>\n    <td>❌</td>\n    <td>🥐🥯🍞🥖🥨🥞🧇🌭🍔🍕🫓🥪🍥🥮🥧🍩🍪🥠</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>Proteins</td>\n    <td>✅</td>\n    <td>🧀🥚🥓🥩🍗🍖🦪🍤</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>Vegetables</td>\n    <td>✅</td>\n    <td>🍆🥦🥬🥒🌶🫑🌽🥕🫒🧄🧅🥔🍠🌰🥜</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>Fruit</td>\n    <td>✅</td>\n    <td>🍏🍎🍐🍊🍋🍌🍉🍇🍓🫐🍈🍒🍑🥭🍍🥥🥝🍅🥑</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>Toppings</td>\n    <td>❌</td>\n    <td>🧈🍯🧂🧊</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>China</td>\n    <td>❌</td>\n    <td>🥄🍴🍽🥣🥡🥢</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>Drinks</td>\n    <td>❌</td>\n    <td>🥛🍼🫖☕️🍵🧃🥤🧋🍶🍺🍻🥂🍷🥃🍸🍹🧉🍾</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>Sides</td>\n    <td>❌</td>\n    <td>🍳🍟🥙🧆🌮🌯🫔🥗🥘🫕🥫🍝🍜🍲🍛🍣🍱🥟🍙🍚🍘🍢🍡🍧</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>Desserts</td>\n    <td>❌</td>\n    <td>🍨🍦🧁🍰🎂🍮🍭🍬🍫🍿</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h4>The End Notification</h4>\n\n<p>Once you’ve selected your desired items in each menu, a notification will popup in shortcuts displaying your finished sandwich with all of your selections (mostly) stacked vertically. In this notification there will also be the generated name for your sandwich based on the names of the emoji’s you’ve selected.</p>\n\n<h4>Wrapping Up</h4>\n\n<p>Once you’ve basked in the glory of your creation for a while (give yourself a pat on the back, that thing looks delicious 🤤), all you have to do to exit the shortcut is tap the “OK” option on the notification mentioned above.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Feedback and Suggestions</h3>\n\n<p>If you have any suggestions for features you’d like to see added in the future or ways to otherwise improve or correct this program, comment them in the “Feedback” section at the bottom of this page.
