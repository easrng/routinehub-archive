Now at 553 actions)<br>New:<br>• Fixed a big where it caused the onboarding screen to repeatedly show up even after setup<br>• Disabled AUC for everyone due to a bug (Manual update checking is still available)<br>• Reworded the setup splash screens<br><br>Updates: <br>I (the developer, cheesetan_) has ultimately decided that the ability to have multiple accounts in a single Clipboard Pro shortcut with different Clipboards isn't of top priority at the moment as it is not a really useful feature to have. I will be more active and updating the shortcut with new features and improvements after my year long break from this project.<br><br>Nonetheless, if most of you are interested in the idea of multiple accounts, please feel free to comment it down below in the RoutineHub comment section, where I will be able to hear your feedback. If enough people want this feature, I might revive it and work on it again, as I have a rough prototype of it as an internal beta version right now.<br><br>Known issues:<br>• When passcode is on, the “← Back” button requires you to enter your passcode again. <br>• Gmail does not support Siri Shortcuts so you need to manually type in my email address to send an email suggestion. <br>• Automatic Update Checker (AUC) does not work as expected because \"your privacy settings does not allow this shortcut to load external content\" and has been DISABLED until a workaround can be figured out. Manual update checks still work.<br><br>Disclaimer:<br>Since iOS 15, Apple's new privacy feature will ask whether to delete a file or “Add Contact to File” (it WILL NOT add any contacts to your address book), click “Always Allow” to avoid that pop-up there again. This goes for the deleting a file pop-up too, as it is just removing the old information saved into Clipboard Pro on your iCloud Drive.<br><br>Unfortunately, there is no workaround or solution to this.<br><br><br>I hope you all enjoy version 1.91!</p>"}
