Then, ssh to your Mac, move the zip to a set location, and open the folder to confirm it made it.</p>\n<p>NewðŸ’¥ now you can save the backup to a local drive, Mac or device with Files.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In Files set up the device connection.\n <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/g7jjjzB/Setup.jpg\"></li>\n<li>Then run this Shortcut and choose, \"Copy archive\".\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/VSS65Mz/Share.png\"></li>\n<li>Choose the server you set up previously.\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/0FsRJQc/Share-2.png\"></li>\n<li>Navigate to the directory and save where you like.\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/KmZkRqM/Share-3.png\"></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is handy when you canâ€™t or donâ€™t want to AirDrop files.</p>\n<p>Note after you airdrop, just tap on your iOS device screen the next step (SSH to your Mac) will commence.</p>\n<h1>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h1>\n<p>This shortcut has an integrated update mechanism called  <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\">Embed-a-Update</a>. Thanks to the embedded updater, it does not require any external updater shortcut. The shortcut checks for updates itself, so you'll never miss an update and it is super fast. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cpBjhE3_d.webp?maxwidth=1000&amp;fidelity=large\"></a>\n</p><p></p><p></p>\n<p>If this Shortcut doesnâ€™t work as expected, you have suggestions, or an idea to improve it, let me know!</p>\n<h2>Updates</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Added check to see if you are on a default wifi network before backing up (this is to ensure you aren't looking to connect to a Mac or Linux box that isn't there.) </p>\n<p>If you are not on the specified wifi, option added to switch networks.</p>\n<p>You can simply leave the wifi black if you want to bypass this check, but doing this may mean your iOS/iPad device can't find the device you are looking to backup to.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added attempt to wake the device you are trying to back up to in case it is asleep. (Note, only supports Macs.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Made \"todoist\" optional. The idea of this is to open an existing recurring todoist item that reminds you to backup your shortcuts. You have to set the value to <code>true</code> and update the taskid from todoist.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Instructions</h1>\n<p>In the dictionary in the shortcut, set the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>To set hostname, use IP address of Mac if it is a fixed address (see Settings&gt; Networks) or go to Settings &gt; Sharing on your Mac <code>MacBook-Pro.local</code> in the example below if you use DHCP. \n    <img src=\"https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/osx/yos_sys_sharing_files.png\"> </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You must also set the username you use to login to the Mac with. If you donâ€™t know what that is, go to terminal and look at the prompt. It usually will before the \"%\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>Set the password of the Mac you want to login to.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you donâ€™t configure these things, the shortcut canâ€™t login to your Mac.</p>\n<h2>Related Shortcuts</h2>\n<p>See also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3772\">Shortcut Info</a> which can give you a report about all your shortcuts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LUwfRgzcpmS1TGzv-yyAC2T7-5yBsgCkiK91qY-8YcA/edit?usp=sharing\">Routinehub Dashboard</a>  See  <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/erjxt8/routine_hub_dashboard_10/\">Reddit</a>  for instructions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Backup a Shortcut)[https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1048] save a shortcut to your iOS device</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Import Shortcut)[https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6340] restore a shortcut to your iOS device that you saved locally.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.8.0 - April 29, 2021, 5:02 p.m.</strong></p><p>Added ability to save archive via Files to any Mac, network drive, Windows, or Linux box.</p>"}
