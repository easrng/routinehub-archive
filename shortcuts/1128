I don't need Siri to read me things, I want to fire off an email to myself with all of the information I need for today so that I can sit down and digest the briefing when I get to work or on my commute.\nTo me, THIS is what shortcuts was designed to do.\nEach section is commented out so that you can can edit and adjust these as necessary.\nAlthough time-based triggering is (hopefully) coming in the future, this manual email aggregates a LOT of useful information (and also some fun stuff too!). Upon launching the shortcut, you will receive a customized email with the following information, all added with basic HTML to make it look nice to start your day. I have tried to cite those that I used in the shortcut as best I could:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A warm greeting</li>\n<li>The current date</li>\n<li>A random quote <b>(u/JoeReally)</b> (remember that you can only call this 5 times in 1 hour)</li>\n<li>A random r/Showerthoughts <b>(u/CRShelton)</b></li>\n<li>Your horoscope for the day <b>(u/doinbox)</b> (make sure to spell it correctly)</li>\n<li>Today's top news (I've already replaced it with my personal choice)</li>\n<li>Today's weather forecast from Carrot Weather</li>\n<li>The extended forecast from Carrot Weather</li>\n<li>Your scheduled events:</li>\n<li>All Day</li>\n<li>Remainder of events</li>\n<li>Your reminders:</li>\n<li>Due today</li>\n<li>List of additional reminders</li>\n<li>Upcoming birthdays (the next 5 on your calendar...I made this shortcut a while ago but adapted it: https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/9ue06p/upcoming_birthdays/)</li>\n<li>If the birthday is today, you will get a notification as well so as not to forget!</li>\n<li>A random joke to end your email</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hope you like it, and please let me know if you update it with other useful items!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Dec. 3, 2018, 8:34 p.m.</strong></p>"}
