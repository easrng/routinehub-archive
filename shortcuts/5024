{"id":"5024","name":"Resize Images","tagline":"Resizes images to a set length on the long edge—not just the width.","icon":"ios13 c946986751 g59784","latest":"16220","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This shortcut resizes images to a set length to reduce size and set images to a particular size. Wait, aren’t there lots of other Resize Image shortcuts? Why would I want this one? 2 reasons:</p>\n<p>✅ This shortcut resizes the long edge of the image—not just the width like most resize shortcuts.\n✅ You can resize multiple images with this shortcut, not just one.\nThe default size is 1200px, but you can easily change it to whatever you’d like. I hope you enjoy it. This was the first shortcut where I learned the “Repeat with Each” action so it’ll always have a special place in my heart. ❤️</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - April 14, 2020, 5:50 p.m.</strong></p>"}
