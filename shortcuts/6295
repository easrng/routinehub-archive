It hasn't been updated in a few years, so I updated it the way I liked and changed a few things.</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think. If it doesn't work as expected, let me know and I will see if I can fix it to meet your needs.</p>\n<h1>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h1>\n<p>This shortcut has an integrated update mechanism called  <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\">Embed-a-Update</a>. Thanks to the embedded updater, it does not require any external updater shortcut. The shortcut checks for updates itself, so you'll never miss an update and it is super fast. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cpBjhE3_d.webp?maxwidth=1000&amp;fidelity=large\"></a>\n</p><p></p><p></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1.1 - Sept. 16, 2020, 5:22 p.m.</strong></p><p>Updated for iOS 14</p>"}
