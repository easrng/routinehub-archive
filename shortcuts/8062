When capturing the thought, I have a few goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Get it out of my head and into a text box, as soon as possible, before I forget it</li>\n<li>Capture the thought in a note with related ideas</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This shortcut helps with that.</p>\n<h2>Usage</h2>\n<h3>Capturing a Thought</h3>\n<p>You can run this shortcut directly from the shortcuts app, from the share sheet, or add it to your home screen.</p>\n<h4>From the Home Screen or Shortcuts App</h4>\n<p>If run directly, Note Taker will prompt you for the thought you want to capture and then append it to a note.</p>\n<h4>From the Share Sheet</h4>\n<p>If run from the Share Sheet, Note Taker will still prompt you with the text you passed it, allowing you to add your own thoughts or change the text before continuing.</p>\n<h3>Adding to a Note</h3>\n<p>Once Note Taker shortcut knows what thought it is capturing, it will search for notes with the text <code>shortcuts-tag-thoughts</code>, and:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If <strong>0</strong> notes are found, it will offer to create one</li>\n<li>If <strong>1</strong> note is found, it will append to that note</li>\n<li>If <strong>&gt; 1</strong> notes are found, it will ask you which you would like to append to</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>See it in action</strong>:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.lukezilioli.com/images/note-taker.GIF\"></p>\n<p>In this case, the shortcut found 2 notes matching the <code>shortcuts-tag-thoughts</code> tag, so it prompts me for which note I would like to add the thought to.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lukezilioli.com/blog/post/note-taker\">Read my blog post.</a></p>\n<p>Got work-specific ideas you need to capture? Download the <code>shortcuts-work-note</code> version of this note <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8197\">here</a>. <strong>Note:</strong> You will need to install the Note Taker shortcut for the customized <code>shortcuts-work-note</code> version to work.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Usage</h2>\n<p>As explained above and by default, Note Taker searches for notes that contain the text <code>shortcuts-tag-thoughts</code>. But you might want to create a customized version that searches a different tag. I do exactly that for work so that I can capture notes for things I need to bring up in a 1:1 or upcoming meeting.</p>\n<p>Download the <code>shortcuts-work-note</code> version of this note <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8197\">here</a>. <strong>Note:</strong> You will need to install the Note Taker shortcut for the customized <code>shortcuts-work-note</code> version to work.</p>\n<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>\n<p>Note Taker normally accepts input from the share sheet, or nothing at all, but if you create a Dictionary and pass it to the \"Run Shortcut\" action, you can customize Note Taker's behavior.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  \"ACTION\": \"append\",\n  \"tags\": [ \"shortcuts-work-note\" ],\n  \"allowMultiple\": true,\n  \"shortcutInput\": \"&lt;shortcut input&gt;\",\n  \"defaultNoteTitle\": \"Work Notes\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Each option in the shortcut's input is explained below:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ACTION</code></td>\n<td><code>append</code> | <code>search</code></td>\n<td>1. <code>append</code> this shortcut will behave as described above.<br>2. <code>search</code>, this shortcut will exit early with all of the notes that match the <code>tags</code>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>tags</code></td>\n<td><code>string[]</code></td>\n<td>A list of tags to search for. When finding notes to append the message to.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>allowMultiple</code></td>\n<td><code>boolean</code></td>\n<td>When selecting which note to append your idea to, should Note Taker let you select multiple notes or just 1?<br><strong>Why?</strong> For work, I have 1:1's with a few people. Sometimes I have a thought that I want to bring up in my 1:1 with multiple people. Configuring the Work shortcut with <code>allowMultiple: true</code> allows me to capture the thought into multiple 1:1 notes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>shortcutInput</code></td>\n<td><code>&lt;anything&gt;</code> | <code>&lt;shortcut input&gt;</code></td>\n<td>What should we append to the note? Typically you will want to pass the shortcut input along here, but if you are using Note Taker in a more complex use case, you can pass anything here.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>note</code></td>\n<td><code>&lt;anything&gt;</code> | <code>&lt;shortcut input&gt;</code></td>\n<td>Optional parameter. If provided, Note Taker will use this note in addition to the <code>shortcutInput</code>, and skip prompting the user. This is useful if you want to write a fully automated wrapper for Note Taker that prompts for user input before invoking the Note Taker shortcut.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>defaultNoteTitle</code></td>\n<td><code>string</code></td>\n<td>Used as the title of the created note when no notes matching the <code>tags</code> can be found.

If you have a shortcut that calls out to this shortcut, you will need to update it. In most cases you can simply rename the `note` key to `shortcutInput` and the shortcut will function as it did preciously.
