Previewing these markdown will be exactly the same as seeing it on RoutineHub.</p>\n<p>You can even run this shortcut with text from the Share Sheet to speed up the process. Just select your text and press \"Share...\".</p>\n<h2>RoutineHub Markdown Preview Options</h2>\n<h3><em>Full Screen</em></h3>\n<p>Using the full screen preview option, you can turn your markdown code into a RoutineHub description. Take the following code for example:</p>\n<pre><code>***\n\n# look Here\n\n`this is code`\n\n***\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Will become:</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>look Here</h1>\n<p><code>this is code</code></p>\n<hr>\n<p>As you see, it looks exactly like on RoutineHub.</p>\n<h3><em>Master View</em></h3>\n<p>This option will need internet connection. It will create a <strong>replica</strong> of the shortcut's RoutineHub page with your created markdown replacing the real description. The new markdown will not be changed on the real RoutineHub. Most of the links will not work as well. This is an easy way to see what your markdown will look like on the RoutineHub page without editing its markdown description.</p>\n<p>For this option, you will need the shortcut's RoutineHub ID. To find this, you can go on the shortcut's RoutineHub page, copy the URL and extract the  ID:\nThis is an example URL: <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9073/\">https://routinehub.co/shortcut/<strong>9073</strong>/</a>\nThe ID is 9073.</p>\n<p>Take this code for example:</p>\n<pre><code># This is what the new Sharp Updater screen could look like\n- This page is a replica, nothing will work on it.\n- I could change the real Sharp Updater description to this\n- This just shows what it will look like on the shortcut's RoutineHub page\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Will become:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkpicture.com/view.php?img=LPic60a12249482151064836303\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://www.linkpicture.com/q/63131158-8E70-4D00-A8EB-FA534F79B593.jpeg\"></a>\nIf I go back on the <strong>real</strong> RoutineHub page, this description will not be saved as the real description.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - May 17, 2021, 9:08 p.m.</strong></p>"}
