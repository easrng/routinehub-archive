The release notes state that some unnecessary actions were removed to increase speed. This is correct in the sense that some of the actions introduced in previous versions that were unnecessary were removed to result in faster performance. However, the action count says that version 2.5 has an extra two actions than version 2.4 or 2.4.1.  This is because of the new changes to the update checking UI and the new about UI.</p>\n<p>So, some actions were removed and then these new menus brought the count back up again. In any case, if those actions still remain, the system would be slightly slower. So if those actions had remained, there would’ve been even more actions hoping this clears any misinterpretation, please accept this apology. All work and all thought is being put into the system to make it yours. If you have any suggestions, you absolutely need to comment on and they will be looked into immediately. Sorry for any inconvenience or misinterpretation. </p>\n<p>With more advanced capabilities, and tapping instead of swiping, this is the system for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch for quickly adjusting your settings.</p>\n<p>Important\nPlease read the following article about important changes coming to the way updates are released as of version 3.0.\nVersions will be separated into different release branches:\nOfficial final stable builds;\nBeta builds (including RC);\nRC only;\nDevelopment addition with experimental features.</p>\n<p>Those people under stable builds will only get finished builds that have came out of testing stages and are officially ready. Those on RC only will get pretty stable updates (more stable than dev additions but may contain a few minor bugs before officially released).</p>\n<p>Most probably though, these builds will most likely be the ones official users will see.\nUsers in beta branch will see features tied to a specific build in testing. Those in experimental features branch will see all upcoming features not tied to a specific build.</p>\n<p>Features will be pushed to other branches when ready.</p>\n<p>Make sure you select the addition right for you.</p>\n<p>You can change the setting at any time in newer versions. Quick Controls 2 will reach end of support in 2026. In the meantime, we might see version 2.4.1 add iOS 15 compatibility. Quick Controls 3 will start rolling out to experimental features branch first. All features that are ready will make it into the first beta build.\nWith a new major version around the corner, it is crucial that you leave feedback.

This is part of a new menu where update checking has also been moved to. You no longer see the automatic prompts as it is understood how frustrating it can be. However, it is recommended that you do check for updates once in awhile. Along with moving the UI to the New menu, it has been refined to give you a better experience. When you click on a branch to download a build from, it now takes you to version history instead of the main page (in case you want to roll back or find a specific version in particular). Also, some unnecessary actions have been removed to result in faster speeds and quicker controlling of system settings.<br><br>Please comment your experience with this version as your feedback is important for new features to be added, bugs to be fixed and other changes to be made.</p>"}
