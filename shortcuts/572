A shortcut where you can control the most of your device. <b>This shortcut is being built from scratch for the upcoming 2.0 update, coming soon. Check out the planned features below.</b></p>\n<blockquote> DOWNLOAD the iOS 13 / 14 Version Here: <i>Link Coming Soon, will post when 2.0 is posted</i></blockquote>\n\n<h3>Coming in 2.0:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I also have plans to make Device Control back to being Universal, meaning all iOS Versions are able to use it again.  <b>This is what keeps users lenient on updating, since of jailbreaks, unstable versions, etc... However, once I update to 2.0, iOS 13 or 14 &lt;u&gt;IS&lt;/u&gt; required. There will be no more updates being posted here.</b></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Multiple Language Support via TranslateHub.. this has been in the works for awhile, but since iOS 14 is coming out, I decided to ship it with the 2.0 release because it’ll be a hassle for me to go through everything and since I want a redesigned menu, I decided to rewrite it</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I found an article that was posted that you can now launch a specific setting with a URL! This will take some time, but I will be supporting it in 2.0.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Redesigned Menu.. I know my menu is simple with emojis, but I want to have a menu that is much more cleaner instead of having a simple menu. <b> I cannot implement this at the moment because vCard menus are “bugged” in iOS 14. </b></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Toolbox Pro.. now I’m investigating into this, but for certain parts of the shortcut, you will need Toolbox Pro, an app that adds more functionality to shortcuts. The app has some features that will be awesome for me to incorporate into my shortcut, you will need the app in order to execute the function. I will have a “requires Toolbox Pro” icon or I will include it in a separate menu setting, I’m still deciding on that. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More to come later.. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p></p><h5> Progress v2.0: </h5>\n<i>I am aware that iOS 14 is in beta and unfortunately, I cannot update to have a universal version for iOS 13.
