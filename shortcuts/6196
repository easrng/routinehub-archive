I just can't shave every single day or my skin gets irritation. So I shave every other day, sometimes every 3rd day, but I want to replace my blade after 7 uses. </p>\n<h4>The Solution</h4>\n<p>I made a shortcut. I think it's best to invoke with <em>Hey Siri, I'm shaving</em> so that you can call the shortcut even when there's shaving cream on your hands.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>When first installed, let's you set how many times to use a blade.</li>\n<li>When run, increments the count and tells you how many times the blade has been used.</li>\n<li>Reminds you when to change the blade.</li>\n<li>Judges you if you tell it you want to use the same blade more than 21 times.</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.0 - Aug. 11, 2020, 4:09 a.m.</strong></p>"}
