Tap again to undo the filter.</li>\n</ul>\n</li></ul>\n<br><br>\n\nIn the next version I hope to add info pages with information on evolutions, eggs/breeding, where to catch, stats, etc. \n\nIf you have any feedback or suggestions I’d love to hear them! I am learning to code and this project is both for fun to help me with my Pokémon journey and I also am using it to practice my coding skills as most of this is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - May 14, 2020, 11:34 p.m.</strong></p><p>Added update feature.
