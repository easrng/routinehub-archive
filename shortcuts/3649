This means the only way to restore a shortcut from a backup is if you do so from an iCloud link.</p>\n<p>This shortcut walks through the process of creating an iCloud link for each of your shortcuts, and saving the links to a text file. The file is then saved to the Files app with the date and name of your device. This makes it easy to restore old versions of shortcuts if needed.</p>\n<p>In a future version of this shortcut I may support creating an “exclude list” of existing shortcuts to automatically skip when performing a backup task.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.0 - July 23, 2020, 8:20 p.m.</strong></p><p>Generate all links with a single click instead of requiring a click for each shortcut.</p>"}
