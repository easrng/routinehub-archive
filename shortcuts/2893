While this is happening, some newcomers may believe it difficult to get started building \"good\" shortcuts. starterKit aims to eliminate (or at least reduce) this supposed difficulty, providing some awesome features out of the box.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>UpdateKit support</strong> - This will allow you to provide quick and easy updates to your Shortcut, using RoutineHub. If a user does not have UpdateKit, starterKit makes it really easy for them to fix this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>RoutineHub Ready</strong> - starterKit includes a \"Help &amp; Support\" option, which (when used correctly) will lead to your RoutineHub profile.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Menu-centric Design</strong> - Out of the box, you are provided with a main menu, and a \"Settings\" option, with \"About <em>shortcut title</em>\", \"Check for Updates\" and \"Help &amp; Support\" sub-options also pre-configured.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Simple Configuration</strong> - Most of the settings you need to configure are located at the top of starterKit - if there are any extras, it's because you put them there! :)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Quick Start Guide:</h2>\n<p>First, download starterKit. Stop. Do not immediately edit it.\n<em>Instead</em>, duplicate it, and edit the copy. Trust me, this saves the headache of having to re-download starterKit every time you're making a new Shortcut.</p>\n<p>You'll find a dictionary at the top - fill in the blanks, or replace the information with your next shortcut's details. The \"author\" field should contain your RoutineHub username - this is so the \"Help &amp; Support\" option in the Settings menu works correctly. If the user activates this option, it opens Safari to your profile on RoutineHub.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dictionary - \"app\"\n// title, author, version, id</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Next, you'll need to create a new shortcut on RoutineHub. The \"id\" field in the dictionary is the \"RoutineHub ID\" for UpdateKit. Make sure to fill this in also.</p>\n<p>Once you have completed the steps above, you're ready to start building your shortcut! Have fun - be sure to share with me what you create - Tweet @Dean0DC and show me what you've made!</p>\n<hr>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - June 1, 2019, 6:09 p.m.</strong></p><p>Fixed “About” alert in Settings<br><br>Added emojis for decoration</p>"}
