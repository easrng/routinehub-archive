This Silent version only contains 50 actions and delivers lighting speedy results, but will not save UU Files. The UU Files Functionality will be added in the future. <br>- Weâ€™re also planning to upgrade HSAG Ultimate Updater (Embed) to HSAG Ultimate Updater in the near future, for which this update serves as a backbone.</p>"}
