This is called '<strong>remuxing</strong>'. But since not all codecs are supported by all formats, this conversion can fail. <strong>WARNING</strong>: Be sure to check if the source file audio codec is supported by the output container format before trying to remux.  </li>\n<li>You will also be asked if you want to <strong>normalize</strong> the volume of the files.  </li>\n<li>Wait the shortcut to end all the processing, without touching anything, and after a while you will be asked where to save the resulting MP3 / M4A audio files.  </li>\n<li>To avoid confusion, a suffix '(was xxx)', where xxx is the previous file extension, will be added to the file names.  </li>\n<li>If you select <strong>video files</strong> they will be converted <strong>to audio only</strong> MP3/M4A files.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Calling it from other Shortcuts</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>From version 1.0.2 you can use ENCODE TO MP3 as an helper function in your shortcuts.  </li>\n<li>For the details and the parameters, just read the comment inside the shortcut source.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Supported audio formats:</h1>\n<p>AAC, AC3, AIFF, ASF, AVI, CAF, DFF, DSF, DTS, F4V, FLAC, FLV, HEVC, M4A, M4B, M4R, MAUD, MKA, MKV, MOV, MP2, MP4, MPEG, MPG, OGA, OGG, OPUS, TS, TTA, VOB, VOC, W64, WAV, WEBM, WMA, WMV, 3GP.  </p>\n<h1>Some Background On Audio Quality</h1>\n<p>Bitrate is not the only thing to consider when it comes to codecs.  </p>\n<p>Frequency response range is also very important.  </p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Codec</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Format</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Transparency</strong></th>\n<th><strong>File Size</strong> (at Transp.)</th>\n<th><strong>Frequency Response</strong> (at 192 kbit/s)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>MP3</td>\n<td>.mp3</td>\n<td>250 kbit/s</td>\n<td>1.87 MB/minute</td>\n<td>0-16 kHz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AAC</td>\n<td>.mp4</td>\n<td>220 kbit/s</td>\n<td>1.65 MB/minute</td>\n<td>0-18 kHz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Opus</td>\n<td>.ogg, .webm</td>\n<td>190 kbit/s</td>\n<td>1.42 MB/minute</td>\n<td>0-20 kHz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>WAV</td>\n<td>.wav</td>\n<td>lossless</td>\n<td>10.58 MB/minute</td>\n<td>0-22 kHz</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Glossary</strong>:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Transparency</em></strong> : <em>\"A transparency threshold is a given bitrate value at which audio transparency is reached. Transparency is the result of lossy data compression accurate enough that the compressed result is perceptually indistinguishable from the uncompressed input for the </em><em>average</em><em> listener.\"</em>  </li>\n<li><strong><em>Frequency Response</em></strong> : <em>\"The analysis of the frequency spectrum of each song shows how well each code compression algorithm works in comparison to WAV and each other. Its shows when frequency cross-section of the codec leads to the loss of high-frequency part of the sound. Then codec with the biggest frequency range is the codec that provides the nearest reproduction value of the full frequency spectrum in comparison to non- compressed WAV with the range of approximately 22 kHz.\"</em>  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Source:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zhurakovskyi, Bohdan, Nataliia Tsopa, Yevhenii Batrak, Roman Odarchenko and Tetiana Smirnova. <em>“Comparative Analysis of Modern Formats of Lossy Audio Compression.”</em> CybHyg (2019).  </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>REQUIREMENTS</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>You need the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/ao/app/a-shell-mini/id1543537943\"><strong>a-Shell Mini</strong></a> app installed.
