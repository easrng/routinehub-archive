Shortcuts offers a native \"Change Case\" action, which gives the option to <code>cApItAlIzE wItH aLtErNaTiNg cAsE</code>, but this is not true to the meme. If you do not wish to use TextCase, and are okay with alternating case (which is lame compared to TRUE SpongeBob mockery), I created a <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8084/\">free version</a> that removes the need for TextCase. But I encourage you to support third-party developers. TextCase is a great app. <em>no affiliation</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.2 - Jan. 13, 2021, 7:25 p.m.</strong></p><p>Bump the version and publish manually so that the icon is fetched since the routinepub shortcut is broken</p>"}
