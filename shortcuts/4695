This is the first shortcut I’ve ever put together and I’ve worked on it for several months to perfect it. </p>\n<p>The first thing it does is gets your current location. It then uses that to calculate your drive time to work and get relevant weather info. After that it then assembles a script for Siri to greet you, tell you the current time and full date, the current temperature and weather and summary of the conditions for the day. And finally it tells what time you should leave for work by. </p>\n<p>Ideally this is to be set to an automation trigged that is tied to your wake up alarm. But you can run it independently whenever you want. If you drive to your job and have a regular routine, this is for you! </p>\n<p>It has variable phrases so it doesn’t say the same thing every day. And on your birthday it’ll wish you happy birthday.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.43 - March 5, 2020, 3:55 a.m.</strong></p>"}
