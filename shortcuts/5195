Do not change the name of the shortcut from \"Instagram Media Saver\" otherwise the setup may not work properly</strong> </p>\n<h4>Test Script for Scriptable (may be needed)</h4>\n<p>If you run into an error that mentions an object is null or cannot be found, you should run a script to ensure that the app is working properly. An example script can be copied from <strong><a href=\"https://pastebin.com/raw/FFeGRe2d\">this location</a></strong> and pasted into a new script in the scriptable app. </p>\n<p>After you run it, the app should then work without issue to help in downloading Instagram media via the shortcut. The reason that Scriptable is needed / used now is due to the ability to store user cookies between sessions in the app. This is the reason for being able to download public and private media via the new methods implemented in the shortcut and also reason the shortcut has been reduced in action count.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Getting Started</h3>\n<p>Upon first running of the shortcut, you will he asked to choose which storage location you'd like media saved (\"iCloud Drive\", \"Photos\", or \"Don't Store, Share Only\"). </p>\n<p>If you choose \"iCloud Drive\", photos and the \nwill be saved to the Shortcuts/Instagram Media Saver folder.
