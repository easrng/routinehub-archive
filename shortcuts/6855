It is what you would use for your own charging sound. You would copy your MP3 file from your Files app by holding down and hitting copy. Then you would go into your Shortcut app then hit the three dots on Clipboard Grabber. Then You Would Hit The Play Button in the bottom right corner. It might ask to access the internet thatâ€™s ok just hit allow. Then a box should pop up with the stuff you paste into the charging sound shortcut. You would copy it by hitting the share button on the little box that popped up after you played the shortcut then hit copy.
