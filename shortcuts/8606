{"id":"8606","name":"Diff Library (For Comparisons)","tagline":"Allows your shortcuts to compare data (what changed for example)","icon":"ios14 c2071128575 g61456","latest":"25890","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This library is fairly basic, but offers functionality that isn’t already in any native action. You can pass a dictionary of 2 data sources and it will send back what is different. It can compare a single set of same type data (text+text,number+number,bool+bool,etc) or a whole set of data inside a dictionary. For the dictionaries to work it must be an identical structure. (Other structure comparisons haven’t been tested)</p>\n<p>If you need to see what things were changed in a form that had been edited, this is perfect. You can log that data out to a file or a data jar, or global variable, etc.</p>\n<p>Personally I needed it in a complex and robust shortcut that I built to handle gift certificates in a massage spa. I wanted to track what was edited and when, and by who. I just pass the data and bam... the changes are returned almost instantly. I log it all out to a data jar field and can view it any time.</p>\n<p>If you have any feedback please let me know! I plan to make a much more feature rich library (CompareKit) if this gets enough traction.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - March 5, 2021, 7 a.m.</strong></p>"}
