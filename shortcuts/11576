This is intended for use in the UK, given that we are calculating UK gallons, however, this can be adapted for use in other countries and for other currencies.</p>\n<p>Note, when you run this shortcut, you'll be asked three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Cost per litre of fuel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Size of the fuel tank in litres (check manufacturer documentation)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Estimated miles per gallon. You could base on the theoretical MPG provided in manufacturer documentation, by checking your MPG based on the trip calculator in your car, or take an average MPG on driving on mixed types of roads.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The following is calculated in the shortcut:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Cost of a Full Tank of Fuel</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Range is provided based on your estimated MPG (miles per gallon)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cost of Fuel per UK gallon</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cost of Fuel per mile.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You'll then be asked if you want to calculate the cost of a trip, assuming you know the distance.</p>\n<p>If you answer yes, it will perform a calculation of cost of fuel per mile * number of miles which you enter.</p>\n<p>The output will be the total cost of your trip.</p>\n<p>If you answer no, then the shortcut will finish there.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1 - April 13, 2022, 11:32 a.m.</strong></p>"}
