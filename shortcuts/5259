It also works for YouTube music playlists and can be invoked from Safari, the YouTube app, or the YouTube Music app. Note: thereâ€™s a bug in the YouTube api which restricts some common playlists to 26 tracks (nothing we can do about this). Your personal YouTube playlists should work fine though.</p>\n<p>I'm uploading it here as it might be useful to anyone looking to use Playlisty within a shortcut.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.4 - Feb. 3, 2022, 3:26 p.m.</strong></p><p>Updated for iOS15</p>"}
