{"id":"5505","name":"Directions to Next Event","tagline":"Get directions to your next event - Drive, Walk or Public Transport","icon":"ios14 c1440408063 g59452","latest":"21130","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Directions to Next Event is one of the first shortcuts I made.\nHope you like it.</p>\n<p>It will get your calendar event/meetings, then will ask you how you want to get there (car,walking, public transport), then will calculate the time to your event/meeting accordingly to your previous selection and what time you should leave to get there in time. Last it will open Google Maps for the directions. You can change the navigation app if you don't like the Google Maps.</p>\n<p>Also there is an option to create a reminder for the time you have to leave if you choose \"Later\". For this to work you must create a new List in Reminders App and name it \"Next Event Directions\" or anything you want and choose that list in the \"Add New Reminder\" action. It will notify you when you need to leave.</p>\n<p>You can add as many persons as you want in the \"With\" dictionary.</p>\n<p>As always if you have any suggestions please leave a feedback. Enjoy!!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>3.0 - Sept. 26, 2020, 6:57 a.m.</strong></p><p>Replaced \"Find Calendar Events\" with \"Get Upcoming Events\".<br><br>So now if your event has already began, you can still get directions.<br><br>Before it was possible to get directions if only 10 min had passed since the start time of the event. Now you can get directions even if it's 5 min before the end of the event. <br><br>After the end time of the event you can't choose it from the list, that hasn't changed.</p>"}
