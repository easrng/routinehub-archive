Features:<br>\n• Supports packaging worlds and packs (resource/behaviors that you’ve custom-made) in a format readable by Minecraft on iOS for easy importing <br> • Supports exporting to Minecraft <br> • Sound effects across the shortcut from the game can be toggled on and off within the shortcut’s settings <br> • Caches exported files for easy retrieval in Shortcuts/Minecraft Studio/Packaged Content (more cache features coming soon) <br></p>\n<p><strong>To get a world file for packaging</strong>, locate the world’s folder in On My iPhone/Minecraft/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds by checking each folder for the levelname.txt file, which will be the name of the world you want to backup. Once you’ve located the world’s folder, simply select all the files and folders in the desired world’s folder and hit the ••• icon at the bottom right of your iPhone’s screen, followed by “Compress”. The file you need will appear and be named “Archive.zip”, so just copy it to your clipboard or move it to a folder where you can easily find it. You can also rename the zip file to your world’s name if you want. Now you can run the shortcut and select if the file is a world or pack, and the shortcut will handle the rest.<br></p>\n<p>Let me know of any bugs you encounter in the comments section. I’ll be updating this with vCard menu interface and automatic dark mode support in the future. <br></p>\n<p>Graphics made with <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911\">MediaKit</a>. <br></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Does not work with Minecraft Marketplace content, only custom content downloaded from outside of the game or your worlds you’ve created.
