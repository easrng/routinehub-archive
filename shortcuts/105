{"id":"105","name":"Watermark your Photos dynamically","tagline":"Add automatic watermarks to your beautiful photos before you share them online","icon":"ios12 c463140863 g59784","latest":"897","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Watermark your pictures</h1>\n<p>Add a logo or icon as a watermark to your photos in camera roll. The icon is embedded in <em>multiple</em> variants for different occassions. </p>\n<p>Please read the setup instructions provided below. </p>\n<p>I made an example with a picture of my cat:\n<img alt=\"Picture\" src=\"https://i.redd.it/yfzb5j4gnjr11.jpg\" title=\"Picture\"></p>\n<h2>Features:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You can embed multiple icons for different situations: light background, dark background, variable background. No need to store them somewhere on your phone. They are embedded in the shortcut.</li>\n<li>The icon will be automatically resized to 20% of the photo-height (default setting, you might change it). Therefore it's always the same relative size to the photo.</li>\n<li>The icon will be automatically positioned with a 5% offset (% of photo-height/width). You can choose the corner within the shortcut: upper-left, lower-left, upper-right, lower-right.</li>\n<li>Open the shortcut directly from the share sheet. It will take the opened photo and watermark it. If you open the shortcut from the app or widget, it will instead open camera roll for you to choose a photo.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the Shortcut. | If you use UpdateKit please duplicate and rename it, since you donâ€™t want your own watermark to be overwritten to the example pictures if I release a new version.</li>\n<li>Get your watermark(s) ready in camera roll. The icon must be on a rectangular canvas (makes resizing much more easy). I recommend a high dpi PNG with low bit-rate and transparency. </li>\n<li>Download <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f8954802c9574450a1d82d9a85207816\">this shortcut</a> and run it. Choose a version of your watermark. It will generate an Base64 code for the watermark and copy it to your clipboard.</li>\n<li>Go to the section in the original shortcut where the different versions are stored and replace to example-text in the container with your newly generated code.</li>\n<li>Repeat for every different version of the watermark (white/black/highcontrast/etc.)</li>\n<li>Enjoy!</li>\n</ol>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2.0 - Oct. 25, 2018, 11:25 a.m.</strong></p><p>Works now from the share sheet in the photos app. <br>Added a option to Save directly to Camera Roll or Share.</p>"}
