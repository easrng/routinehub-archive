In that folder, there are many subfolders with the names of the Shortcuts that you are self-hosting. In each of those subfolders, there will be 2 files named  <strong>\"Update Info\"</strong>  and  <strong>\"Changelog\"</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Update Info</em>  will contain the dictionary required to check if your Shortcut is up to date and the link to that file will be your Update URL.<br>\n<em>Changelog</em>  will contain all of the release notes, versions, and iCloud URL's for that Shortcut.</p>\n<p>File Directory-  <strong><em>Beta Updates/{Shortcut Name}/Update Info|Changelog</em></strong></p>\n<h5>Why Dropbox?</h5>\n<p><strong>A.</strong>  I simply prefer Dropbox and it also has a built-in editing tool, so if by any chance you want to edit something in your document, you can edit it easily.</p>\n<h5>Why did you create this Shortcut?</h5>\n<p><strong>A.</strong>  Ever since publishing my <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2500\">Publish Update</a> Shortcut, I have realized that a handful of Shortcut developers are interested in making betas for their Shortcuts. They have used sites such as Netlify to achieve their goal, but I wondered if other users would like to make their own beta Shortcuts, but didn't since they would have to go through all of the fuss with signing up and creating accounts. I, therefore, created Beta Updates which does everything in a simple 1, 2, 3 through Dropbox.</p>\n<h5>What is that other file called \"Shortcuts in Beta\"?</h5>\n<p><strong>A.</strong>  Testers of your Shortcuts receive data from that link about which Shortcuts that they should be testing and the iCloud link for that Shortcut.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Disclaimers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Version numbers must only have one decimal place (ex. 1.0 and not 1.0.1)</li>\n<li>If you change the name of your Shortcut, then there will be a new folder created and you will have to move the old files back into the new folder</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2066\"><img alt=\"UpdateHub\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8tugTDE.png\"></a>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911\"><img alt=\"MediaKit Credits\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kXmXRXJ.png\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/user/AShortcuts\"><img alt=\"Author AShortcut\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/hX2x10B.jpg\"></a>\n<a><img alt=\"Dropbox\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vyOO5vS.png\"></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.0 - July 10, 2019, 12:31 a.m.</strong></p><p><br>Version 2.0 Release Notes<br>- Added UpdateHub Support <br>- Added UpdateKit Support <br>- Added RoutineHub ID (I forgot to add this last time)<br>- Improved Feedback dictionary<br>- Many bug fixes</p>"}
