To check for Swing Updater updates you need to use this tool.</p>\n<h4>Interface</h4>\n<p>Are you looking for a pretty interface? Swing Updater has a clean and one of the most beautiful interfaces made with icons, this helps new shortcut users updating shortcuts. Swing Updater has 2 themes, Swing and Modern, both themes were made in Photoshop by me and they fit the iOS style and Swing Updater interface.</p>\n<h4>Popularity</h4>\n<p>Because of the users, Swing Updater is one of the most popular updaters in RoutineHub, probably your users already have it installed!</p>\n<h4>Fast SFU Returning</h4>\n<p>When running SFU for the second time (4 hours or less between the first run) Swing Updater will ask you if you want to load the SFU presented in the first run or Check For Updates again!</p>\n<h4>System Updates</h4>\n<p>Swing Updater is the <strong>first</strong> updater that check for updates for your shortcuts and checks for iOS/iPadOS updates! This feature is in SFU so if you run it and System Update appears in the list, it’s because an update is available.</p>\n<h4>RoutineHub, ShareShortcuts, Anywhere</h4>\n<p>Do you want to publish your shortcut in another place? Like ShareShortcuts or in your Server? Ok, it’s alright, Swing Updater supports the 2 most famous Shortcut Sharing Websites and even your server if you want it too!</p>\n<h4>Updates without leaving</h4>\n<p>You probably had updaters before that open Safari and require you to click in “Get Shortcut” on iCloud page to download the update, Swing Updater automatically updates your shortcut and doesn’t open Safari!</p>\n<h4>Multi-Language Support</h4>\n<p>It’s Swing Updater, Atualizador Swing or Swing 更新器. Whatever is your language, Swing Updater know how to talk it, just select it in the Setup screen and (like French people say) voila, Swing Updater it’s in your language.</p>\n<h3>Developer Tools</h3>\n<h4>Swing API</h4>\n<p>You can get the information about an update or know what Swing Updater version the user is running using Swing API, there are 2 API's:</p>\n<p><strong>CheckFU</strong> - Get information about an update if it is available.</p>\n<p><strong>SUVerCheck</strong> - Get the version of Swing Updater that the user is running.</p>\n<h4>Integrations</h4>\n<p>Swing Updater has 2 integrations, the normal integration and the SFU integration, you can know more about them with Swing Integration Example shortcut (Check bellow).</p>\n<h4>Result Codes</h4>\n<p>Do you want to run specific actions depending on what the user have chosen? When Swing Updater stops running, it will output some result codes. (You can know more about Result codes with Swing Integration Example shortcut).</p>\n<h4>Developer features</h4>\n<p>Developers have lots of features to personalize Swing Updater to their needs, like Silent Mode, Custom Icons (Update/Rollback prompt), remove the “Congratulations, no updates were found” alert <strong>and even more!!</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Custom Icons</h4>\n<p>If you ever looked to Swing Updater Update/Rollback interface, you probably noticed about that beautiful icons, but sometimes it doesn’t combine with your shortcut interface. Now imagine that Update/Rollback interface but with icons matching your shortcut, it will look better right? That’s why Swing Updater allows you to do that and even more! (You can know more about Custom Icons with the Swing Integration Example shortcut).</p>\n<h4>Don’t check frequently</h4>\n<p>With Swing Updater you are able to check for updates once a day or once a week or how many days apart you want! Just check the documentation webpage to know how this feature works.</p>\n<h4>Connected Experiences</h4>\n<p>Users can Check for Updates in your shortcut or by running SFU (Only if you have the normal integration, if you have the normal integration you don’t need the SFU integration because Swing Updater automatically prepares it for you).</p>\n<h4>Speed</h4>\n<p>Swing Updater main purpose isn’t speed but it’s always welcome, Swing Updater takes 1 second to check for updates on iPhone XR 64GB iOS 13.2 (Normal Mode). SFU speed varies depending on how much Swing Updater compatible shortcuts you have.</p>\n<h2>How to integrate it?</h2>\n<p>First of all, thanks for being interested in integrating Swing Updater in your shortcut, <a href=\"https://d3w10.netlify.app/swingupdater/documentation/\">here</a> you can find all the information you need and <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2797\">here</a> you can find a basic integration.
