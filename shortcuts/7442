Since Apple removed the download all button under songs I made this shortcut which makes a playlist and I can just download the whole playlist to get all my music downloaded.</p>\n<p>## TL;DR\nMakes playlist to download all music in iCloud, easier than downloading songs individually</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Nov. 18, 2020, 8:53 p.m.</strong></p>"}
