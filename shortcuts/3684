This shortcut does it and makes it sound natural. If an event has a location set, it tells you how long the drive is, but only if it’s over 15 minutes. Only if there’s rain expected at all, it will tell you the chances of rain in the coming hours. And if you launch it in the afternoon, it will tell you tomorrow’s weather instead of today’s.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Oct. 14, 2019, 4:23 p.m.</strong></p>"}
