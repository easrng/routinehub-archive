For the times RoutineHub is slow","icon":"ios14 c1440408063 g59771","latest":"26354","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Since RoutineHub has been slow the past few days many Shortcuts with automatic Updaters have either experienced huge performance hits or have been unusable. So I just created this updater with the hopes that maybe some of you will choose it in their Shortcut.</p>\n<p>It is an <strong>Embedded Updater</strong> which means it will automatically embed itself into a shortcut of your choosing. </p>\n<p>I tried to make it as user friendly as possible so you can easily adjust the time between update checks, the path where the file will be saved and the method to open an update link before even embedding it.</p>\n<p>It has all the basic features and will show the new Version number as well as the update log when an update is found. The user can then either choose to update or skip the update.</p>\n<p>That's all, have a nice day :D</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.2 - March 25, 2021, 12:46 a.m.</strong></p><p>New Link, since all the old Links are currently broken</p>"}
