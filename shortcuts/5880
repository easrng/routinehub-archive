The Shortcut will copy your completed menu out on to the clipboard.</p>\n<h2>Using in your shortcuts.</h2>\n<h3>DIY</h3>\n<p>If the images are used in a list along with a piece of text eg a prompt, will force it to appear as a list with images, rather than show the image browser.  </p>\n<p>Example of how to use the data copied out in your own Shortcut here: </p>\n<p><a href=\"Example Shortcut\">https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/63ac890844bc44a6a10caf6a5adcaaba</a></p>\n<h3>Function (easy, but)</h3>\n<p>An example of an easy way to add the menus to your Shortcut but Menu Builder 14 must be installed. A great way to quickly and very easily add image menus to Shortcuts you probably won't be sharing to people. You only need to add a dictionary, and a run Shortcut command. </p>\n<p>Dictionary should be </p>\n<pre><code>Process : Menu Builder\nMenu: (what is copied out of Menu Builder ie b64 archived images) \nInput Type: Single/Multiple\nMessage: for the prompt.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Example Shortcut using the built in function: \nhttps://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/268e866c8bdb43dea066f0661d53f75d</p>\n<p>This is also available as a separate external function, so you can provide it with any Shortcut you want to share. These helper Shortcuts aren't very popular though and most people like a self contained Shortcut.
