{"id":"765","name":"Add Items to my List","tagline":"A handy shortcut that allows you to dictate multiple items into a Reminders list of your choosing.","icon":"ios12 c4274264319 g59798","latest":"2465","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Simply say the items you would like to add to your list at the prompt.  You can chain multiple items at once by saying <code>“and”</code> between each item.  You can also add notes to each item by saying <code>“note”</code> followed by your notation after each item. </p>\n<p>i.e.:   You can say...  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>“paper towels</code><br>\n<code>and toilet paper note the soft kind</code><br>\n<code>and soap”</code>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...and the shortcut will add the following :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paper towels</li>\n<li>Toilet paper [the soft kind]*</li>\n<li>Soap</li>\n</ul>\n<p>* <em>(added as a note to the reminder)</em></p>\n<p>To complete your session, you can say something like “<code>Finished</code> | <code>Nothing</code> | <code>I’m all set</code> | <code>That should be all</code>” or <em>26 other phrases</em>... or you can simply say nothing at all (although she might be offended).</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<h4>features:</h4>\n<p><strong>Redundant items</strong>  -  will not be added to your list unless the redundant items contains a note, then they will replace the item in your list.  You will be informed on how many redundancies were skipped, or you will be prompted to click the remove button to replace an older item with the newer one containing a note.</p>\n<p><strong>Various Siri responses</strong>  -  Siri has a bit of personality in this shortcut.  Her responses to many of the steps are quite varied and sometimes a bit snarky.  This will all be updated regularly by the author without the need for re-installing, so you might occasionally hear some new responses as time goes on.  If you have any Siri dialogue suggestions, be sure to let me know on Reddit u/OpticSugar</p>\n<p><strong>Address multiple lists</strong>  - <em>new in 1.1.2!</em><br>\nYou can now use this shortcut to work with multiple different lists!  Simply say:<br>\n- <code>”Change the list”</code> - To switch to another list for the current session<br>\n- <code>”Save this list”</code> - to use this list indefinitely (after you quit)<br>\n- <code>”Revert list”</code> - to go back to the list chosen in your prefs  </p>\n<p><strong>UpdateKit</strong> - this shortcut will check for the latest version each time you finish using it (You must install the latest <a href=\"http://www.mikebeas.com/updatekit/\">UpdateKit</a> shortcut for this to work)</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong> <em>from the author</em>: I created this because I found it <em>very cumbersome</em> to do this with SIRI traditionally:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>\"Hey Siri: add bread to my shopping list\"</code><br> \n<em>...wait for her to do it...  “I’ve added it!”</em><br>\n<code>\"Hey Siri: add milk to my shopping list\"</code><br>\n<em>...wait for her to do it...  “I’ve added it!”<br>\n(rinse, repeat)</em><br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hope you find this useful.  You can hit me up with questions, comments, bugs or suggestions here or on Reddit at <a href=\"http://reddit.com/u/OpticSugar\">u/OpticSugar</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1.3 - Nov. 21, 2018, 7:56 p.m.</strong></p><p>•  added a tutorial!  Just ask for \"Help\".<br><br>•  created a message if you try to save the reminders list that is already your default list.<br><br>•&nbsp; You can now see a list of the different ways you can issue each spoken command to siri.  Just say \"Command options\" and choose which command.  There are even more acceptable ways to issue these commands beyond what is listed here, but this should give you an idea on how flexible the syntax is.<br><br>•  'phrases' is now renamed to 'dialogue' and lives in a new file on my server (AIL_dialogue.txt).  This now contains not only all of Siri's various responses, but also regex strings for interpreting your speech into commands, and lists of possible commands that will work.<br><br>•  changed how the goodbyePhrase was processed by now using regex, which should allow for infinitely more possibilities for ending the shortcut.<br><br>• &nbsp;moved the regex for change, save and restore list commands over to the web hosted dialogue json file.  This way I can make tweaks to the language of spoken commands as well as Siri's dialogue and it will get updated live to users (without the need for installing a new version of the shortcut!)<br><br>•  implemented a more streamlined way of selecting a different reminders list when saying 'change list' (by adding a temp item and asking you to choose which list).  This will instantly give you a complete listing of all your reminders lists - the only drawback is that it must ask you to delete the temp item after you've chosen your list.<br><br>•  added a diagnostic mode for development testing.  By default, it will just switch to text input mode, but if you have the AIL_test input wizard.shortcut, it will come up with a robust menu system for testing out different spoken phrases and items.  I created this so that I could test this shortcut without constantly talking out loud (which began to drive my co-workers crazy).  The link to install AIL_test input wizard shortcut is hidden in a comment in this shortcut.<br><br>•  changed it so the import question writes your default reminders list into the first text node, which uses a magic variable into the following dictionary (to workaround an issue encountered from import questions).</p>"}
