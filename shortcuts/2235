Ultra Low Power Mode 2.1 is a Shortcut that saves battery (although, you probably can tell that from the name). This Battery Saver also allows you to choose how much battery you want to save, unlike some other power savers.\n</p><h3>Why Ultra Low Power Mode?</h3>\nUltra Low Power Mode 1.0-1.8 was made by @JuhJuhButts, and Ultra Low Power Mode 1.9 Beta - 2.1 is made by @zachary7829. Ultra Low Power Mode 1.9 Beta and Up has iPhone, iPad, and yes, even iPod Touch support, so you can enjoy extended battery on almost any device. 1.9 and 2.0 also support iOS 12 &amp; 13, so you can use it on older firmwares. This shortcut also uses QuickUpdate: Integrated Edition, which not only means you’ll be up to date, but there will be barely any speed difference, and you’ll have a lot of features with updating.<p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Ultra Low Power Mode shortcut, with 3 levels of low power, intelligent adjusting, and reverting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n</p><h5>Note: As of 9/23/2019 JuhJuhButts no longer updates this shortcut.
