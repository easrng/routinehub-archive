Then you have to type the cost per KWh at the charging station. You can specify the currency later.</p>\n<p>The shortcut calculates the price of the trip and you can see the result. Now you can share it to your friend, Copy it to the clipboard or save it to the notes.</p>\n<p>You can automate this shortcut using the NFC tag at the charging port.</p>\n<p>I would like to add potencial saving (beside classical vehicle with combustion engine), average time spent in car, average speed and other features.</p>\n<p>I would appreciate the feedback.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.2 - April 24, 2020, 2:47 p.m.</strong></p>"}
