Optionally you can password protect your message to make it even more secure. The secret and hidden message can only be revealed with the same Shortcut. No internet connection required—works completely offline.</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/312362038\">Video Demonstration</a></p>\n<p><img alt=\"SteganoGraphy is 100% Malware Free\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3gZZqIZ.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;  </p>\n<h4><code>Important Note:</code></h4>\n<h4><code>Since a bug in iOS 13 can cause the Shortcuts app to crash on some devices when the shortcut is executed, SteganoGraphy 1.2.1 is now opened externally in Safari.</code></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;  </p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Attention:</strong> Technically your message will be encrypted to the image’s color values. That said, if the image gets cropped, resized or compressed afterwards the message gets lost. If you use this Shortcut eg with iMessage, make sure that <em>Low-Quality Image Mode</em> is turned off (under Settings &gt; Messages). </p>\n<h2>Encode</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Import image from Photos</li>\n<li>Type/Insert message</li>\n<li>Password protect message (optional)</li>\n<li>Tap button »Hide Message«</li>\n<li>The generated image will be shown at the bottom of the page</li>\n<li>Tap and hold on image to save it</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Message length limit = 1000 chars! Why? The bigger the message the bigger the image needs to be. That said, this Shortcut needs a character length limitation to guarantee it works with almost every image you would like to use.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"SteganoGraphy Part 1/5\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Hr8J3R3.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"SteganoGraphy Part 2/5\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3NoO1LE.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"SteganoGraphy Part 3/5\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/u8rrylT.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>Decode</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Import image from Photos</li>\n<li>Type password (if the message is password protected)</li>\n<li>Tap button »Reveal Message«</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"SteganoGraphy Part 4/5\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4B4QLTx.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"SteganoGraphy Part 5/5\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ldtw2Eu.jpg\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which encryption is illegal.</p>\n<p>Whereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned with concealing the fact that a secret message is being sent as well as concealing the contents of the message.</p>\n<p><em>(Source: Wikipedia)</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h2>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h2>\n<p><em>SteganoGraphy</em> has an integrated update mechanism called <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/793\">Embed-a-Update</a>.
