Please install that first before installing this shortcut.</strong></p>\n<p>This shortcut basically is like @MikeBeas’ AirBag shortcut. It lets you use features like “Safari Tools” and other without crashing Shortcuts. This shortcut is required as All-in-One Utilities has so many actions that it crashes shortcuts when it doesn’t have enough RAM to display the actions.</p>\n<p>This shortcut is completely unnecessary if you are running All-in-One Utilities from another shortcut. </p>\n<p>This shortcut does not fix widgets for All-in-One Utilities. And it will not be fixed until Apple fixes the Shortcuts app.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>3 - Jan. 14, 2019, 7:05 a.m.</strong></p><p>Repurposing this shortcut to be an “AirBag” like shortcut for All-in-One Utilities</p>"}
