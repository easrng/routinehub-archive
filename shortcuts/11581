{"id":"11581","name":"Dawn alarms","tagline":"Gives you alarms for one hour before both the astronomical dawn and nautical dawn","icon":"ios15 c946986751 g59845","latest":"32787","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This shortcut works with the app SolarWatch, to give you two alarms: one for one hour before astronomical dawn, and another for one hour before nautical dawn. Both are set to those times as they exist in your area, which must be set By replacing “Apple Park Way” with your city. There are two “Apple Park Way” spaces that you must do this for.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there seems to be a problem with the alarms and notifications because the alarms are supposed to display a time that is exactly 1 hour before the notifications, however they are only displaying the exact same time as the notifications. I will be fixing this soon.</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.5 - April 19, 2022, 9:10 a.m.</strong></p><p>Added 3 notifications; the first one being a notification that says don’t catch the Sun, and then the next two being notifications that give the time for both astronomical dawn, and nautical dawn.</p>"}
