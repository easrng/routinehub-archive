Works both before and after midnight.</p>\n<p>If you plan to make a Shortcut that you run in the evening before you go to bed, I don't recommend you just edit this one. Instead, make a new Shortcut, then call this one by using the \"Run Shortcut\" action. The reason is that if you did edit this one with your own actions, UpdateKit would delete them when a new version of this Shortcut comes out, and that would be sad.</p>\n<h4>General Info</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Supports <a href=\"https://www.mikebeas.com/updatekit/\">UpdateKit</a></li>\n<li>Requires AutoSleep</li>\n<li>Doesn't work on iPad</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1.0 - April 23, 2020, 2:13 a.m.</strong></p><p>Added proper iOS 13 support</p>"}
