Your token can be used to interact with the Discord API much like you would with a bot account, but with your own normal user account instead.</p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using your token to interact directly with the Discord API is technically considered <em>selfbotting</em> and is against Discord’s <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\">terms of service</a>. However, <strong>bot accounts and webhooks for sending messages are perfectly fine by the ToS, and you should prefer those if possible.</strong> If you must use your own account for bot-like API usage, <strong>make sure not to abuse its capabilities</strong> to avoid being detected.</li>\n<li>Your user token is the most sensitive piece of information about your Discord account, even more sensitive than your password. <strong>Do not let anyone else access your token</strong>, as it gives anyone possessing your token the ability to do just about anything with your Discord account.</li>\n<li>User tokens are created when you log in, and destroyed when you log out. This means that <strong>tokens retrieved with this shortcut are only valid while you are logged into your account in Safari.</strong> As soon as you log out of that session in Safari, the token is invalidated. This shortcut is intended as a proof of concept and for very short-term interactions with the Discord API, not for regular use.</li>\n<li>To get a user token that lasts long enough for regular use, log in with the desktop app and retrieve the token from that: https://discordhelp.net/discord-token</li>\n<li><strong>This does not give you access to the token used by the Discord mobile app.</strong> That is stored within Discord’s sandbox and is only accessible if your device is jailbroken, or if you are using a client modification such as <a href=\"https://enmity.app\">Enmity</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - July 25, 2021, 6:58 p.m.</strong></p>"}
