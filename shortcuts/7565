As with <em>99 out of 100 times</em>, you will get a busy signal. Simply hang up, and the shortcut will automatically redial. It will loop infinitely. Once it answers, just don't hang up (duh) and the shortcut will exit.</p>\n<p>I was able to call about 30 times per minute, getting connected in just a few minutes on average using this tool.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1 - Nov. 25, 2020, 8:43 p.m.</strong></p>"}
