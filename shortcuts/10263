The changelog can be styled differently but follows the relative form of <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_timeline.asp\">w3school's timeline</a>. Shortcut Changelog also contains instructions for embedding, styling, and using the snippet. </p>\n<p>If you do not want to use the snippet in your shortcuts, you can still view any shortcut on Routinehub's changelog using Shortcut Changelog. Just share the shortcut link from Routinehub to the shortcut or copy the id or link of the shortcut and select the View Changelog option when running Shortcut Changelog. </p>\n<h2>How It Works</h2>\n<p>The Shortcut Changelog snippet worked pretty easily. It runs on shortcuts and uses a bit of JavaScript to create the changelog. Unfortunately, since iOS15 shortcuts cannot edit plists, so you will have to embed the snippet manually. Luckily, the snippet is only 7 actions and is decently easy to add. </p>\n<h2>How To Embed</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"Embedded\" src=\"https://www.linkpicture.com/q/4FB4B28B-B264-4315-BC28-0897C3ED180D.jpeg\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Oct. 5, 2021, 11:42 a.m.</strong></p>"}
