UpdateLab checks for updates for all your shortcuts.</p>\n<h1>Why UpdateLab?</h1>\n<h3>All versions support</h3>\n<p>UpdateLab is an updater with something that only a few updaters have, all version support. You can use normal version \"1.0\", multi-decimal versions \"1.9\" and fully worded version \"alpha\" and \"beta\". No matter what you put there, UpdateLab will always show you if you have an update or rollback.</p>\n<h3>UpdateLab Engine</h3>\n<p>UpdateLab uses a special engine. Because of this engine UpdateLab can always detect a \"Update\" or \"Rollback\". </p>\n<h3>Fast and clean</h3>\n<p>UpdateLab is fast and clean, but what you’re seeing is not the full UpdateLab. This shortcut is still in development. You can expect a lot of things in the future.</p>\n<h3>Offline check</h3>\n<p>UpdateLab first will check if a user is offline. This way you don’t have to check if a user is offline.</p>\n<h3>Output code</h3>\n<p>When UpdateLab stops it will output some code. This way you can run specific actions based on the output code.</p>\n<h1>How to integrate?</h1>\n<p>Thanks for being interested in UpdateLab you can find all the information <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/89c0ae25c0854afeaf5c3d1d09fcfba1\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Images</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"UpdateLab\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WcLMhoL.png\">\nUpdate/Rollback menu\n<img alt=\"UpdateLab\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0Tn1u4o.png\">\nMain menu</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>3.1.1 - March 16, 2020, 9:07 a.m.</strong></p><p>• Bugs fixed<br>• Spelling mistakes fixed</p>"}
