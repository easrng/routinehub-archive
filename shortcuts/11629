{"id":"11629","name":"Version Conversion","tagline":"Compares version strings, not convert.","icon":"ios15 c3031607807 g59846","latest":"32796","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>\n<p>This shortcut doesnt detect letters (yet). It separates version number strings by the dot ( . ), making a segment. it starts from the first segment, and if that one isn’t greater than the other string’s segment, it will move onto the next segment and compare those. You may get errors if one string has more segments than the other.</p>\n<p>Also, I know it says \"conversion,\" but it doesn't convert version strings. it COMPARES them. The name just has a certain… ring that I like.</p>\n<h2>HOW TO USE</h2>\n<p>To compare via shortcut input, use the long dash ( —    ⌥ + ⇧ + - ) between the 2 versions like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>22.15.1.0—22.15.1.1</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you do happen to have more than 2 strings, the shortcut only uses the first 2 strings after splitting it from the long dash. Alternatively, you can run it directly from Shortcuts, and fill in the forms to get it a test. The Shortcut will return the larger (newer) of the two.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>22.15.1.0 - April 20, 2022, 1:28 a.m.</strong></p><p>- Initial release</p>"}
