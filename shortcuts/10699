For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Duration</li>\n<li>Aspect ratio (for video)</li>\n<li>Dimensions (for video)</li>\n<li>Sample rate (for audio)</li>\n<li>Frame count</li>\n<li>Frame rate (for video)</li>\n<li>Codec</li>\n<li>Language (if defined)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The data is generated by the <a href=\"https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html\">ffprobe</a> program, which in <strong>iOS</strong> is available through either the <strong><a href=\"https://holzschu.github.io/a-Shell_iOS/\">a-Shell</a></strong> (~900 MB) or <strong>a-Shell mini</strong> (~300 MB) apps. Both are free and open source. Before version 1.5, in iOS 14, the shortcut can't detect by itself which one is installed, so an import question asks the user which app is installed.</p>\n<p>From version 1.5 on this question is not necessary, both apps work without distinction in <em>iOS 15</em>. In <strong>macOS 12</strong> the shortcut checks if the <em>ffprobe</em> command is available via shell, and if not, downloads it and uses it. No other software is necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>The output of the shortcut is a dictionary with all the metadata.</strong> Without input the shortcut works as a demo, allowing the user to pick a media file and see the metadata in table format. With input the shortcut works as a function, generating <em>silently</em> the output dictionary.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Version 1.5 adds compatibility with macOS 12 in exchange with iOS 14 compatibility, but <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/download/31019/\">version 1.0 of the shortcut is 100% functional in iOS 14</a>.</li>\n<li>No error checking (example: <strong>ffprobe</strong> doesnâ€™t support <em>.heic</em> files)</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.5.1 - April 15, 2022, 7:15 p.m.</strong></p><p>Implemented a workaround for a bug in iOS 15.4.1 that deleted the commands in the a-Shell action</p>"}
