This one checks for updates when <strong>you</strong> want to check for updates! It then will email you everything you need to know and a quick link! There is, <em>however</em> one caveat, it requires iOS 14's ability to run automatons automatically. But, there is a jailbreak tweak called <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/fbq6hb/release_truestcuts_100_a_fork_of_truecuts_that/\">TruestCuts</a> that gives you the same exact functionality! This shortcut has been tested and should work perfectly on iOS 13 &amp; 14. Currently, it supports the default Mail app, but you can add a notification or another mail app if it supports notifications!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.01 - July 31, 2020, 6:04 p.m.</strong></p><p>Minor bugfixes</p>"}
