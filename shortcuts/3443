This shortcut allows you to disable, or enable the logging for TeslaMate. </p>\n<p>Very useful say when you get home and you want to explicitly tell TeslaMate to stop talking to the car, giving it an opportunity to sleep. And the reverse, when you are ready to leave instead of possibly missing a drive, you can tell the logger to talk to the car and start logging.</p>\n<p>Your phone needs to be on the same network as where you are running TeslaMate for this to work.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Sept. 1, 2019, 12:48 a.m.</strong></p>"}
