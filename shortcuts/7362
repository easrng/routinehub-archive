No configuration or any other prerequisites such as playlists or third party apps are needed other than your mood. Siri is here to aid you too: just say \"Want some music\" and the song chooser is summoned.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.01 - Jan. 29, 2021, 1:20 p.m.</strong></p><p>Changed sorting order to be done by artist rather than by name of a track.</p>"}
