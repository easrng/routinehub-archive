It will then open two other shortcuts that actually perform the action. Information you'll need to provide:\n* Username/email addressed used to log in to your BlueLink Account\n* Password used to log in to your BlueLink Account\n* VIN # of your vehicle\n* PIN # used to authenticate with the BlueLink app</p>\n<p><strong>Authentication:</strong> Uses the credentials saved in iCloud from Setup to authenticate with the BlueLink server. All BlueLink setups use this, so extracted into it’s own shortcut that can be reused by the others. On it’s own, this shortcut will not accomplish any task, it just authenticates with BlueLink's servers and returns the access tokens necessary to perform subsequent requests.</p>\n<p><strong>RemoteStart:</strong> Authenticates with the previous shortcut and then submits a request to start your vehicle to BlueLink’s servers. Has a dictionary of configurable options at the beginning of the shortcut that you can tweak.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/Hacksore/\">u/Hacksore</a> for building out the API wrapper which the shortcuts are based off of. https://github.com/Hacksore/bluelinky</p>\n<p>As of now, the functionality is pretty limited- it only handles the car ignition and climate control, however using the authentication and tweaking the options in the RemoteAction, full control over the vehicle can be acquired.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Dec. 13, 2019, 6:08 p.m.</strong></p>"}
