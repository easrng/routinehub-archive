I love analog photography so I set out to make a way to add a Polaroid frame to my photos via Shortcuts. This won’t make your photos look like they were taken in the 1970s, but it does add a frame to emulate a Polaroid photo. After you create the photo, it will bring you to a Markup section where you can label or draw on the photo. It works great with the Apple Pencil on the iPad and reminds me when folks would label old family photos Polaroids.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brad.si/efert/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Image.png?resize=2048%2C1677&amp;ssl=1\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - April 14, 2020, 5:55 p.m.</strong></p>"}
