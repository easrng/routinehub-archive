It is a simple shortcut to convert any text you right to an image, then you can select from which photo album you want to save it in.\n So if you want to send a text to somebody but it's an image you could do that, or if you're using it in a project on a video or anything you like, this is a good shortcut for you. Or if you're just gonna put it on your social network account, it could also be good for that as well! Any feedback is welcome, just comment down below.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - June 24, 2019, 12:48 a.m.</strong></p><p>Here are the following changes to this version.<br> When you first start the shortcut you can now enter text instead of having to edit the shortcut entirely. For some reason when I wanted this to happen it didn't do it the first time. You can still save your text to your camera roll photo library, and everything else still works.  If you have any issues please feel free to leave feedback and check here for more versions of this shortcut.</p>"}
