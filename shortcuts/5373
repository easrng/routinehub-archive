This also affects the Share+ menu which is now disabled by default following feedback.</em></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Hi\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZZqQBxC.png\"></p>\n<p>This shortcut will download the artwork of any <em>Apple Source</em> (+all major streaming platforms) in the <strong>highest resolution possible</strong> (usually between 3000x3000 and 4000x4000). All of the following things are supported:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Support\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qDr4gUp.jpg\"></p>\n<p>As you can see it's a total of 12 different things. Whatâ€™s also important to note is:</p>\n<p><strong>Albums</strong> do not only work for Apple Music, but <strong>all major streaming platforms</strong> as I integrated parts of my <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5134\">Song.Link</a> shortcut here.<br>\n<em>Update: now also supports downloading artwork directly from SoundCloud if the song is not found on Apple Music.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Artists</strong> can also be used with links from songs/albums/music-videos. This means that you can also use it with the album link from another streaming platform (the song.link api does not support artist link conversion).</p>\n<p><strong>AppleTV</strong> does not only work for shows from Apple directly, but with <strong>all shows or movies</strong> that you can find in the app.</p>\n<p>You can use <strong>all</strong> media with a link or you can search it from within the shortcut (except AppleTV, Playlists and Radio Stations, there you will be prompted to open the app if no link is found).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Input\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jtqKAXL.png\"></p>\n<p><img alt=\"5773\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mRjes4S.png\"></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Output\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1bYeNql.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>You can also customize almost every aspect of the shortcut!</strong> (all the values are explained inside the shortcut)</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Customizability\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6oolWaJ.png\"></p>\n<p>*The second Dictionary now looks a little different and includes even more options. If you are having trouble changing Settings I uploaded a short video <a href=\"https://youtu.be/prmMecwf5n8\">here</a></p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy the Shortcut :D</p>\n<p>You can also visit my <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/gianflo6\">reddit profile</a> for some more shortcuts</p>\n<p>+the graphics you see here were made with <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911\">MediaKit</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.1 - Aug. 25, 2021, 6:20 a.m.</strong></p><p>- Fixed download of Artist Artwork<br>- Fixed Current Song option showing even if there wasn't one</p>"}
