You enter a keyword and a sentence to encrypt and Cyphr takes care of the encryption. Someone with the keyword will be able to decrypt your message but it will be virtually impossible for someone without the keyword to do so.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"created by robric18\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/SxFga7E.png\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.2 - June 2, 2020, 9:57 p.m.</strong></p><p>Update to improve menu optimization </p>"}
