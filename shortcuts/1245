If you do so your account could be taken down.</h3>\n<p>This is Sleep Mode. Sleep Mode Dims Your Screen Brightness, pauses your music, turns on do not disturb, and low power mode if on an iPad. It sets an alarm to the time you want to wake up asked in the setup process, and sets a good night alarm to remind you to go to bed on time.Plus it sets a reminder minutes before bedtime( the user chooses how many minutes before). You can also choose how many days you want the alarms to go off and the sound that you want to play while you sleep(the nothing option is also available). When you wake up your brightness and volume settings before you ran the shortcut will be restored and do not disturb will be turned off, if you are on an iPhone low power mode will be turned off, and if you want to, a setting in the shortcut allows you to play the same song you where playing before the shortcut when you wake up. However, the music will be paused and will play when you wake up if you have this setting on. Also, if you have this setting on and aren’t playing a song, no song will play when you wake up. When this setting is off the music you are playing before you run this will not play.  Please don’t skip the setup process. I know it is lengthy but if you skip it this shortcut will be broken and will not work.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Dec. 16, 2018, 9:02 p.m.</strong></p>"}
