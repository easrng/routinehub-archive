You write the goods down and then it creates a list in Things App.</p>\n<p>First of all in order for this to work you must have the Things app, obviously. Then you must create a Project in Things called: \"Shopping List\". Inside the new Project you must create 2 headings named \"Local\" and \"Internet\".  Also create a new tag named \"Shopping\". </p>\n<p><b>Shopping List:</b> Every item should be written in a a new line.</p>\n<p><b>Stores:</b> In the notes section I have it to display the a list of stores that corresponds to the items location.\nOf course you can modify this, add, remove or rename in Dictionary called \"Stores\". Also you could delete this dictionary and replace it with \"Ask for Input\" action if you want to write more details.</p>\n<p><b>When:</b> Shopping schedule. It asks for a date.</p>\n<p>As always if you have any suggestions please leave a feedback.\nEnjoy!!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.4 - June 15, 2020, 6:05 a.m.</strong></p><p>Integrated QuickUpdate.<br>Now you don't have to download an additional Shortcut for the updates.</p>"}
