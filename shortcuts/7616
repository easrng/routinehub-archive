Selects a random wallpaper, then sets it as your Lock Screen image, and a blurred version to your Home Screen. User can change which album the wallpaper will be chosen from. And can change the blur amount. Original Blur Image shortcut by Mattijs.</p>\n<p>Notes:<br>\n-I’ve tested this on a iPhone 12 mini and 2020 iPad Pro 12.9”   </p>\n<p>-Portrait images don’t work always work correctly  </p>\n<p>-You can change the resolution of the blurred image where it says “Resize Cropped Image to 1280 x Auto Height.” 1280 is a bit pixelated on the larger iPad Pro screen, but looks good on an iPhone. If the number is too high, it’ll result in a white image or error on the iPhone.</p>\n<p>-I personally like Blur Amount set at 25 for a lighter blur, 75 for a heavier one. But it can be changed to anything in the Number event. “Set variable Blur Amount to Number”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/fiQJfyQ3SL8\">Video</a></p>\n<p><img alt=\"alt text\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/iV2O9SH.jpg\" title=\"Title\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.01 - Nov. 29, 2020, 1:01 a.m.</strong></p><p>-Updated to (hopefully?) work with the R⤓Updater</p>"}
