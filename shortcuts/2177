I have 382 shortcuts and losing shortcuts is common with me. I forget the name so I can’t search in the normal  shortcuts search bar but remember the file size or something like that but shortcuts doesn’t identify that if I type it in the normal search bar.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>It’s OK to be unorganized. ShortSearch has got you Covered</h3>\n<p>With ShortSearch you can sort your shortcuts by selecting factors from a menu. This helps keep your collections organized and neat.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Remove bulky old shortcuts you never use!</h3>\n<p>ShortSearch doesn’t only cover as a smarter search bar it can also help you remove unnecessary shortcuts by selecting criteria.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"Made By Jonathan Setzer\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VBd5870.png\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Suggestions?</h3>\n<p>Feel free to comment them in the feedback section below :).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/ACpp6bO.png\">madewithmediakit</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - March 4, 2019, 3:52 p.m.</strong></p>"}
