{"id":"6283","name":"Get Wind Direction","tagline":"Returns human readable wind direction from Get Current Weather","icon":"ios13 c4274264319 g59717","latest":"19906","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This is an example shortcut, meant to be used or modified in other shortcuts.</p>\n<p>It displays the wind speed and wind direction.</p>\n<h3>The problem with wind speed</h3>\n<p>The Get Current Weather action returns a number for wind direction, from 0 to 350 in increments of 10. It's not very readable by a human to describe the wind direction as 180 though.</p>\n<h3>A dictionary to the rescue</h3>\n<p>What this shortcut does is use a dictionary with 36 entries for each of the wind directions (from 0 to 350, counting by 10). For example, 0 is north, 180 is south, and 210 is south-southwest. </p>\n<h3>A Better Approach</h3>\n<p>At the time of publication, there is another shortcut on RoutineHub that returns the Wind Direction, but it involves an unwieldy and lengthy series of nested IF statements. The approach in my shortcut is cleaner and takes far fewer actions.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.0 - Aug. 19, 2020, 11:03 p.m.</strong></p>"}
