Easy steps, missing actions made into shortcut to speed up cleaning &amp; reviewing processes with your Files.  Closed loops and hierarchical sub-menus made to be easy and fast but powerful. </p>\n<p>Required Shortcuts for this bundle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>CheckStorage - Calculate iCloud + iPhone drive usage</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Folder Size - Recursively find how much folder you select consumes your drive space</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Compress Folder - Compress folder and all of it’s content and subdirectories into an archive of a custom format. You can delete or keep the source folder in post-action. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>File Manager - because I love files and file management actions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Photo Cleaner - Archive or Delete photos you select (2 selection options), open archived location afterwards or keep selecting another bunch of pictures…. powerful in combination with File Manager, as you can change to directory and archive while you see new zips to be filling your destination. Each archive is named with unique tags, containing date + number of photos automatically. Or you can open another photo cleaner if you want to… links are then on to you to be adapted, if you don’t have apps I linked installed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - July 2, 2022, 4:30 p.m.</strong></p>"}
