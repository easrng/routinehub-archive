You add a transaction of $30 with John and YOU COUNT YOURSELF IN as well. That means only half the expenses are logged as John's. You can do this for groups as well, just select as many people as you like and it'll divide and round up the expense equally between everyone. At anytime you can check your balance with anyone by choosing View Balances. You can also check individual transactions, and their timestamps.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This Shortcut has integrations for these shortcuts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>UpdateKit</strong> by Mike Beas.
