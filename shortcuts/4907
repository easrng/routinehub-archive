You may setup a password manually, or a shortcut may configure its own password. All passwords are encrypted. To setup a password for a shortcut that supports PassKit: Run the shortcut, and it will ask you for a password. If it prompts you for a \"Facade\" password afterward, that Shortcut’s dev has written some code that presents a fake version of the shortcut if that password is inputted, like a \"safeword\" to let the shortcut know you are being watched or controlled.
