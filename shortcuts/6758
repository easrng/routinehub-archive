If you prefer another output (e.g. a one instead of \"online\", and a zero instead of \"offline\") change the <code>'online':'offline'</code> near the end of the line (e.g. by <code>1:0</code>).</p>\n<p>I use \"Get File of Type\" instead of \"Get Contents of Webpage\" to avoid that the user is misleading told that the shortcut uses Safari.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.0 - Sept. 30, 2020, 7:45 p.m.</strong></p>"}
