{"id":"10968","name":"WordleBot (Normalized)","tagline":"Makes shared Wordle results even more accessible by converting emoji to images and adding alt text.","icon":"ios15 c4292093695 g59673","latest":"31642","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I've combined the best of both <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zmknox/status/1479606198253109251\">Wordle Normalizer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/ios/wordlebot-1-1-now-fully-accessible-with-native-emoji-to-image-conversion/\">WordleBot</a> to make a more complete solution for those who can see the emojis and those who use screen readers. It keeps the mechanics of WordleBot, but before converting the grid to an image, it replaces the colored squares with their more distinguishable counterparts from Wordle Normalizer. I also added a couple of quality-of-life enhancements that smooth out the sharing flow.</p>\n<p>My thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zmknox/\">Zach Knox</a> for getting the ball rolling and to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci/\">Federico Viticci</a> for doing the heavy lifting on this shortcut. I decided not to change the 'WordleBot' name since most of it is still Federico's work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heydingus.net/blog/2022/1/shortcut-redux-an-even-more-accessible-wordlebot\">You can read about this shortcut's creation on <em>HeyDingus</em>.</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - Feb. 1, 2022, 3:59 p.m.</strong></p><p>- Added a flow to include a game comment as part of the shortcut.<br>- Reformatted the final text to put the game comment first.<br>- Included a link in the comments so users can find the latest version of this shortcut on RoutineHub.</p>"}
