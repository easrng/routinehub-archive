Reimagined.</h3>\n<p>A few months ago, I discontinued Wallz, a Shortcut which was capable of resizing any image to wallpaper size, or a resolution of your choosing. I simply didn't have the motivation to keep updating it, and 1.5.1 was the final version. That was it. Wallz was dead.</p>\n<p>But not anymore.</p>\n<p>I had the idea to rewrite Wallz from the ground up a little while back. So I started chipping away at it occasionally, and here is the final product.</p>\n<p><strong>New features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Completely rewritten image resizing algorithm.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Favorited Wallz: save and access your favorite resized images in a safe place in the cloud.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Completely redesigned vCard menus.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wallz Reborn now handles image height as intended.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Option to set a resized image as wallpaper (why didn't I incorporate this before?).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Option to save a resized image to Photos.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, I hope you enjoy this! I love you all. ðŸ’™</p>\n<p><em>Note: Wallz Reborn requires the following to function:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>An internet connection</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>The Files app be installed</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>iCloud Drive enabled for Shortcuts</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.2 - June 15, 2021, 12:11 a.m.</strong></p><p>- Changed how Wallz Reborn handles image height. This change is experimental and I will revert it I feel it necessary. Feel free to leave feedback on RoutineHub or contact me on Discord @quake#3378.</p>"}
