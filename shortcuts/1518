Quickly change your wallpaper in under 30 seconds!</p>\n<p><em>Over 150 wallpapers!</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>An album called <code>ShortPapers</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A file in your iCloud: <code>/Shortcuts/Wallpapers.zip</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Running this Shortcut the first time should download the zip file. After that, it will skip the step and continue. (Thanks  to Reddit user <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nilayperk\">nilayperk</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Running it after that will grab your copy of the wallpapers.zip and then grab a random item from the list and then decode it and let you preview.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It then asks you if you'd like the photo if you say no, it will rerun the shortcut until you get one you like.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It will then save the photo to an album called <strong>ShortPapers</strong>, where you can then set it as a wallpaper. <em>As of now Shortcuts can't set wallpapers, so this is as good as it gets.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After returning to the Shortcuts app, it will ask if you want to delete the photos. <em>It will stay as a wallpaper even after deleting.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I added an option to blur the image after saving to photos.
