It can already run Shortcuts, this Shortcut just creates a plug in that allows you to also pass a parameter in from the search bar, It will create a script make it executable, and move it into your scripts folder.</p>\n<p>Whilst you can use this on iOS to create the plug in script, only the desktop version will make the script executable, and move it into the correct directory. Although thinking about maybe I could make a version that does that through ssh for iOS.\nHope the folder instructions aren't too confusing,</p>\n<p>Example below is a Shortcut called IMDB, that has been turned into a plug in accepting the movie name, (Raycast already has a great way of adding a search for a website so this example isnt so much needed but more of an example.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ibb.co/3YgxnpD\"><img alt=\"Raycast\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/LhVT3xL/Raycast.jpg\"></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1 - Nov. 14, 2021, 6:28 p.m.</strong></p>"}
