{"id":"10289","name":"PUBG Stats","tagline":"Look up your most recent PUBG match stats! (PUBG for PC ONLY)","icon":"ios14 c2071128575 g59742","latest":"30090","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This shortcut looks up the last completed match that a player has fought and gets the various statistics for that player. You need to provide your own API key (obtain at https://developer.pubg.com/ , it's a really long string of text so I recommend copy/paste instead of typing it in).</p>\n<p>It will ask you for a default player name as well, so you can put in either your in-game name, your favorite streamer name, or have it default to mine (bucksnort2). Remember: The player name is case sensitive, so typing \"bucksnort2\", \"Breon\" or \"chocoTaco\" will work, while \"Bucksnort2\", \"breon\" or \"chocotaco\" will not work.</p>\n<p>After you input the player name, you will get a notification saying it may take a moment because it's sorting through a lot of data. I plan on making it faster in the future, as well as including UpdateKit support for when new modes or maps come out.</p>\n<p>After you confirm and the data has been read, your results are ready! They include data points such as: what map and game mode was played, number of kills, how many kills were headshots, longest kill, how many boosts/health items you used, damage dealt to other players, how you died (or chicken dinner) how far you traveled by different methods, and what place you came in.</p>\n<p>By tapping the data, you can hit the share button to save it or share it with your friends!</p>\n<p>Feedback is welcome, tweet/dm me on twitter (@bucksnort21) or come watch me on twitch where I play PUBG and other games! (feedback is welcome there too!) https://twitch.tv/bucksnort2</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Oct. 7, 2021, 5:42 p.m.</strong></p>"}
