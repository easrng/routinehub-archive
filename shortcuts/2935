Omega Power Mode has less than 90 actions, but yet manages to save a lot of battery! This shortcut uses QuickUpdate: Integrated Edition. I made this because I waited for Ultra Low Power Mode 1.9, but I kinda got fed up with waiting so I made this! (Edit: ULPM was abandoned by it’s original creator, so now I update it.) Credit to @ROP, as the download badge below was made in MediaKit.</p>\n<h2>Optimize Your Battery</h2>\n\n<p>This shortcut asks you how much you want to save power by letting you choose three different levels of power usage: Minimum Power Saving, Medium Power Saving, and Maximum Power Saving, to ensure you’ll have both lots of battery and get a nice user experience.</p>\n<h2>Support for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch.</h2>\n\n<p>Omega Power Mode has stable support for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch. This means you can optimize &amp; save battery on all apple devices that support iOS 13 or higher, and optimize &amp; save battery on all macs that support watchOS 7 or higher.</p>\n<h2>Support for iOS 13 &amp; iOS 14</h2>\n\n<p>Omega Power Mode also has support for iOS 14, too!
