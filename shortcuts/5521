Using redirect, it will take you to an advertisement or some webpage. You can even get rewards if it takes you to a place where you can spin the wheel, sometimes take you to advertisements about, appliances, and many more. sometimes it may redirect you to VPN sites. Maybe you could prank your friends with these!\nThis uses a webpage that will redirect to a random ad or website, basically the same thing. Sometimes it might take you to the same thing you visited, but just keep going. Sometimes it might redirect you to Apple Music. It also may redirect you to news.
