(You could save or share the image before continuing). </p>\n<p>Exclude airlines: \nAir Canada &amp; WestJet are the two major airlines in Canada. This option lets you select to include or exclude either airline. </p>\n<p>Similar Airports:\nAdd in an airport code to have it added in the Destination search. </p>\n<p>Regardless of cabin class, the result will appear in the shortcuts app. </p>\n<p>Similar to how you can customize a home airport. In the future I’d like to have this shortcut show you all the flights a specific airline has partnerships with. Different airlines have different partnerships, and depending on why your flight is cancelled can alter your options.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>4.7 - Oct. 29, 2018, 10:01 p.m.</strong></p><p>Fixed: Current Delay report &amp; Weather in destination when adding a second airport searches.</p>"}
