After a quick search I did not see anything like this on the Interweb, so I wrote this very simple iOS 13 shortcut to provide me the visual i desired. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/thVgmyd.gifv\"></p>\n<p><strong><em>Next Planned Update:</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>✅Let me see a map of <em>tomorrow’s</em> events.</li>\n<li>✅Change initial config to let User simply enter their Starting Address.</li>\n<li>✅Allow User to enter a separate/different ending address.</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.20 - Jan. 21, 2020, 2:49 a.m.</strong></p><p>Change Log: 1.11 ➙ 1.20 (2020-01-20)<br>    ⦁   If Today has no events, it will now check tomorrow. <br><br><br>Previous Updates… <br><br>Change Log: 1.1 ➙ 1.11 (2020-01-19)<br>    ⦁   Fixed: Did not quit when there were no events for the day.
