Originally created by /u/osnipassos and tweaked by /u/bradart, /u/redv1ew und u/lentys. Original shortcut can be found here: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/115378903bd9482987c3c7a6af7b8bdd and through this reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/9jm2wu/any_tip_for_making_a_pomodoro_timer_shortcut/</p>\n<p>There is also a version that works with Apple Reminders: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4970/</p>\n<p>There are six steps in the original technique:</p>\n<p>Decide on the task to be done.\nSet the pomodoro timer to 25 minutes\nWork or better complete on the task\nEnd work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper\nIf you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (5 minutes), then go to step 2.\nAfter four pomodoros, take a longer break (30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.\nFrom the original shortcut-Post: The stages of planning, tracking, recording, processing and visualizing are fundamental to the technique. In the planning phase, tasks are prioritized by recording them in a \"To Do Today\" list. This enables users to estimate the effort tasks require.</p>\n<p>My changes: - asks for a new or existing task everytime a 25 minute iteration starts - changed short breaks to 5 minutes - added my LaunchCuts tags (can be removed) - added Omnifocus to this version.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Feb. 6, 2021, 3:03 p.m.</strong></p>"}
