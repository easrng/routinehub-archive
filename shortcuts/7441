I have OCD and when calculating the tip I like to start with a 15% tip and then round to the closest whole number.</p>\n<h3>For example</h3>\n<p>Let's say your total is <strong>$12.98</strong>.</p>\n<p>Adding a <strong>15%</strong> tip makes the new total <strong>$14.93</strong>.</p>\n<p>At this point the Shortcut will ask if you <strong>A.)</strong> Want to round up to a <strong>$15</strong> total <strong>B.)</strong> want to round down to <strong>$14</strong>, or <strong>C.)</strong> Don't round the tip at all.</p>\n<p>After you pick what you want to do, it shows you the initial total, initial tip amount, initial percent. and also the Final total, the rounded tip, and the percent tip you would be leaving.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Nov. 18, 2020, 8:48 p.m.</strong></p>"}
