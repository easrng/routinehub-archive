It requires a direct link to work (which means the link must download the Shortcut file directly, not take you to a landing page).</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A direct link as input <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/501\">(There's a Shortcut for that)</a></li>\n<li>Shortcuts App</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to use</h3>\n<p>Pass a direct link over to this Shortcut or have one on your clipboard when you run it. This Shortcut will then take the link and convert it to a URL scheme that will open it directly in the Shortcuts and copy the URI to your clipboard.</p>\n<h4><em>Note</em></h4>\n<p>This Shortcut <strong>won't work</strong> if you run it from the main Shortcuts screen. There is a bug that shows a single \"ok\" button if that happens. To get around it, just run it from the edit screen and/or through <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/501\">another shortcut</a> with \"Show While Running\" switch set.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Oct. 25, 2018, 9:21 p.m.</strong></p>"}
