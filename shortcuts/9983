Keep in mind, that this might take some time depending on your internet speeds since some videos can be upwards of 100MB.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/iRiJFzJ\">Here</a> are some more examples of the animated artwork.</p>\n<p>P.S. if the link you shared doesn't have animated artwork, the shortcut might download other animated artwork it finds on the page. This is currently normal behavior</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.0 - April 22, 2022, 5:07 p.m.</strong></p><p>- Adjusted the Shortcut to changes on Apples Servers<br>- Reworked big parts to run faster<br>- Lowest resolution will now be downloaded first, then the chosen videos will be downloaded in a high resolution<br>- Added Quick Look option at the end of the Shortcut</p>"}
