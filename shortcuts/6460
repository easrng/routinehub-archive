They only tracks driving distance from Point A to Point B. So, if you run Start at a location and then run End after returning to the same location you started from, it will show 0 miles instead of the miles you actually drove.</p>\n<p>You need to run Start and End for each \"leg\" of your trip/route.</p>\n<p>You can run the shortcuts from Shortcut app, widgets, Hey Siri or automations with 2 NFC tags in your car (one for Start and one for End).</p>\n<p>If you have Carplay, create an automation for Carplay Disconnects and add Run End Mileage Tracking shortcut only. You still need to run the Start Mileage Shortcut manually and the End Mileage runs automatically when Carplay Disconnects. It will only track mileage if you had started Start Mileage first (so you are only tracking Work related mileage). Thanks to u/Marquedian for the Carplay automation idea.</p>\n<p>Feedback and ideas for improvement are welcomed.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Sept. 10, 2020, 9:34 p.m.</strong></p>"}
