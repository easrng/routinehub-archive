(Co-created with u/Bep13)</p>\n<p>This is version 1.0.1, and for right now, it just supports the weather. Look forward to future updates with other functions, both from me and other creators.</p>\n<p>Jarvis is actually not just one shortcut. When you first run it, or run after an update, it will prompt you to install any new shortcuts connected to Jarvis. Why separate shortcuts? So you can trigger any function of Jarvis from Siri with just one command. You can trigger Siri and say “Jarvis, how’s the weather?” And Jarvis will respond. Or, if you trigger the main Jarvis shortcut, you can use natural language to get the same results — so you could also ask “is it going to rain?”, “does it look like it’ll be hot out?” or virtually any phrase you’d say to a person when asking about the weather, and Jarvis will understand.</p>\n<p>And if you have your own functions for Jarvis, you can have them added to this shortcut via your routinehub link — you still have full control, can issue updates yourself, and your downloads on routinehub will show up under your shortcut, and your name.  Just email me at jarvis.shortcut@gmail.com to get the process started, as there are a few guidelines for shortcut behavior that need to be met in order to be included.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Jan. 18, 2021, midnight</strong></p><p>Version 1.1 introduces “Jarvis, turn on Do Not Disturb”.</p>"}
