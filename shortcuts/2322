To create your personal MediaKit collection, you'll only need the Mark­down code that is generated when you use MediaKit Upload &amp; Mark­down (part of the main <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911\">MediaKit</a> shortcut).</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h3>With My MediaKit you can <em>Access, Preview, Add, Edit, Remove</em> and <em>Reset</em> your personal MediaKit collection.</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"My MediaKit\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1qJUIOQ.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Access</strong> your graphics and copy the Markdown code to the clipboard. Just select an entry, the rest will be done automatically. Now you can paste the copied code into the editor on the RoutineHub page of your shortcut.</li>\n<li><strong>Preview</strong> your graphics individually or in a group. If you have created a <em>Video Player</em> or <em>Download Badge</em> graphic, you can also test the respective link. Tap on a single entry to activate the individual preview or tap on <em>Overview</em> for a preview of all your MediaKit graphics.</li>\n<li><strong>Add</strong> new graphics. Your clipboard will be retrieved. Ideally the corresponding Markdown code is already in your clipboard: After you have tapped <strong>Add</strong>, you will be asked to create a name for your entry. After that you can insert the Markdown code, which was generated with <strong>MediaKit Upload &amp; Markdown</strong> and is in your clipboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Rename</strong> your entries or replace old ones with new graphics: If you tap on <em>Edit</em> you can choose between <em>Rename</em> and <em>Replace</em>. With <em>Rename</em> you can edit the titles of your entries. With <em>Replace</em> you replace your graphics or edit for example the download link of a <em>Video Player</em> or <em>Download Badge</em> graphic.</li>\n<li><strong>Remove</strong> unused graphics: If you tap on <em>Remove</em>, all existing entries of your MediaKit collection will be displayed. Simply choose which entry you want to remove. That's it.</li>\n<li><strong>Reset</strong> your entire MediaKit collection—this step is irrevocable: If you tap on <em>Reset</em>, all entries will be removed. Don't worry, you have to confirm this step clearly.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h4>Impressions</h4>\n<p><img alt=\"My MediaKit\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tTfaHga.png\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<p><em>If you create graphics using MediaKit, please credit and link as follows:</em><br>\n<strong>Graphics made with MediaKit.<br>\nDownload MediaKit here: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911</strong></p>\n<p><em>If you're using Markdown, simply copy and paste the following to credit:</em><br>\n<code>Graphics made with [MediaKit](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911).</code></p>\n<p><em>Thanks for supporting MediaKit.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h2>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h2>\n<p>MediaKit has an integrated update mechanism called <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/793\">Embed-a-Update</a>.
