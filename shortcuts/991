This is really handy for those times when you are between meetings and you do not have time to sit and compose an email with the meeting notes and action items.</p>\n<p>The shortcut will prompt you for the following items to dictate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Client's name</li>\n<li>The name of the project</li>\n<li>Your action items or notes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Usage</h2>\n<p>There are only three settings that need to be set before you begin using the shortcut.</p>\n<h3>Formatting the Action Items</h3>\n<p>Setting the numberedList value in the configuration dictionary to True or False will set how the action items will be formatted in the email. When dictating the action items in order create separate list items you must say <strong>newline</strong> after each item. E.g.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Janet will bring the TPS report to the next meeting <strong><em>newline</em></strong></li>\n<li>Jules has hit a road block and need to call Mr. Wolf <strong><em>newline</em></strong></li>\n<li>We will need sign off from the client to begin working on the changes <strong><em>newline</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Setting numberedList to True will format the items as an ordered list  like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Item one</li>\n<li>Item two</li>\n<li>Item three </li>\n</ol>\n<p>and setting numberedList to False will format them as a bulleted list like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Item one</li>\n<li>Item two</li>\n<li>Item three</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Setting up email</h3>\n<p>This shortcut does require that you have made at least one email account available to Shortcuts. Just add the email addresses you want to use for the From and To fields in the Send email action.</p>\n<p>The shortcut will display the compose window so you will have an opportunity to add additional email addresses in the To field and edit the contents before the email is sent.</p>\n<h3>What's next?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I'd like to make the prompts configurable. I think this would open up the shortcut to other use cases and allow users to fine tune it to their needs.</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - Nov. 21, 2018, 6:36 p.m.</strong></p><p>Removed dependency on markdown web service</p>"}
