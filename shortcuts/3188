(Untested on iOS 13, but should theoretically work) Please take in mind though that this only creates a copy, and does not modify them. I was kind of nervous of releasing this, since I don’t want to release too many Shortcuts, but since I don’t see any other shortcuts that do this, decided to release this. Please keep in mind that you do not need jailbreak.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>3.1 - Nov. 26, 2019, 9:59 p.m.</strong></p><p>3.1 removes the DRM, as it broke the shortcut for iOS 13.
