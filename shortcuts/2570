Yes you read that right. You can download mp3 files on your iOS device using this shortcut. The first two options are self-explanatory. However the third option needs explaining. So the first step is find your mp3 and press the download button. You will be greeted with the QuickTime player. This is normal. There are three options in the download mp3 section get from current url, get url from clipboard, and type url. You can copy the url and use get url from clipboard or type url then it will get the contents of the url and after that it will prompt you to save the mp3. Get from current url is different. To use this you need to be on the safari website and press the share button. Find shortcuts then select mp3 Tools. Goto download mp3 and then get from current url. Then it will get the contents of the url and prompt you to save the mp3.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1 - May 2, 2019, 8:44 a.m.</strong></p>"}
