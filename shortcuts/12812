Like before, it will automagically name the voicemail per the associated callerid/contact information along with time-stamping it before sending it over to iCloud to back it up. No more exporting unhelpfully named voicemails \"voicemail-xx\" w/ missing metadata.</p>\n<p>Since this Shortcut relies on obtaining the metadata from on screen content, future functionality is subject to whether there are future UI changes that prevent it's function.</p>\n<p>Please visit the project website (<a href=\"https://dev.aetheryl.net/home/projects\">https://dev.aetheryl.net/home/projects</a>) for other helpful projects, provide feedback/kudos, or obtain help troubleshooting this Shortcut.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>v2.0b - Aug. 12, 2022, 12:32 a.m.</strong></p>"}
