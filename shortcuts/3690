Also has the basic ability to view transactions directly in the Shortcut or via Safari in a formatted table. Viewing transactions can be limited to a specific month and will display how much youâ€™ve spent, budgeted and what is remaining.<br>\nTransactions are saved to a file in Dropbox which allows both my wife and myself to enter transactions.  You can also enter split transactions, to handle transactions falling under multiple categories.  If more in depth analysis of the budget is needed, that file can be pulled into Excel for charting and deeper insight.</p>\n<p>Future goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Expand the budgeting feature to allow updating the budget directly in the Shortcut.</li>\n<li>Add ability to locate a specific transaction to either update or delete it.</li>\n<li>Add ability to backup the transaction file on a regular basis.</li>\n</ol>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.01 - Oct. 15, 2019, 11:07 a.m.</strong></p>"}
