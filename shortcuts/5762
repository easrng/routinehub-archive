{"id":"5762","name":"Find All Notes HELPER","tagline":"works around iOS 13.6.1 Shortcuts app bug that prevents retrieval of all Notes","icon":"ios13 c4271458815 g59772","latest":"18431","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This shortcut returns all Notes app <em>note titles</em> sorted by <strong>Last Modified Date (most recent first)</strong>. If it is run interactively, it displays a <em>Choose</em> list* and subsequently opens the selected note. If it is run as a helper, it exits quietly and returns (to the caller) the <em>sorted note titles</em>. To run the shortcut as a helper, the calling shortcut needs to use the <strong>Run Shortcut</strong> action and pass any value (except a Dictionary). The passed value is not used within this helper, it's just used to <em>recognize</em> that it was run from a caller, not interactively.</p>\n<p>* The <em>Choose</em> list heading includes a note count and the number of shortcut runs required to retrieve all of the notes. This could be used in the future to determine if the iOS Shortcuts app no longer includes the <strong>Find Notes bug</strong>. See more information below.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>With iOS 13.6.1 (and iOS 14 Developer Beta 7), the Shortcuts app appears to have a bug with the <strong>Find Notes</strong> <em>(All Notes)</em> action: it returns a <strong>maximum of 26 notes</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>reproduce the bug using this <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d52f0c4f55d94b77a66c704750c06d0a\">simple shortcut</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reddit user <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Shoculad\">u/Shoculad</a> noted this bug and created a helper/function shortcut with a creative work-around. More information <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/cty1dk/retrieve_all_your_apple_notes/\">here</a>. Thanks, u/Shoculad!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Working off u/Shoculad's idea, I created a <a href=\"\">similar helper</a>, but employs recursion rather than a <strong>Repeat</strong> action (that necessitates simple adjustment as a Notes library grows).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following related shortcuts are available on RoutineHub:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5762\">Find All Notes HELPER</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5763\">Call &gt; Find All Notes HELPER</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5764\">Note Smart List</a> </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5765\">Note Smart List [sort settings]</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5766\">Note Smart List (All Notes)</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5767\">Note Smart List (All Notes) [sort settings]</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5768\">Note Smart List (All Notes subset)</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5769\">Note Smart List (All Notes subset) [sort settings]</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All shortcuts above that have <strong>Smart List</strong> in the name, include simple configuration (one <strong>LIST</strong> action) and logic that generates a notes list with specified <em>priority</em> notes displayed (and grouped by <strong>Title</strong>) before all others. After the <em>priority</em> notes, the remainder notes are included, sorted by <strong>Last Modified Date (most recent first)</strong>. </p>\n<p>All shortcuts above that have <strong>[sort settings]</strong> in the name, include the <strong>Smart List</strong> logic above plus the configuration (in the same <strong>List</strong> action) and logic to specify the sorting characteristics: by <strong>Title</strong> (with or without <em>grouping</em>) or <strong>Last Modified Date</strong> of the <em>priority</em> and <em>other</em> notes.</p>\n<p><strong>Find All Notes HELPER</strong> and all shortcuts above that have <strong>(All Notes)</strong> in the name, include the recursion logic that circumvents the iOS bug and returns all of the notes.  Unfortunately, however, shortcuts may not function as expected when they are launched via the <strong>Run Shortcut</strong> action (the technique used to recurse). For example, the <strong>Dictate Text</strong> action sounds the expected chime prompt, but does not display its normal  dialog box that shows the text as it is recognized and includes the red button that is used to dismiss it once speaking is complete.</p>\n<p>All shortcuts above that have <strong>(All Notes subset)</strong> in the name, retrieve a <em>configured</em> number of notes using a <strong>Repeat</strong> action that runs the necessary number of <strong>Find Notes</strong> actions. For many shortcuts, this technique is a good compromise because it is simpler than the recursion technique and does not cause the issue noted above. </p>\n<p>If you are interested in the topic, I suggest you start by downloading, inspecting, and testing <a href=\"\">Find All Notes HELPER</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Note: I discovered the above iOS 13.5.1 bug while testing a new version of <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5578\">Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</a>. To address the bug, version 2.0 of that shortcut includes the logic from <strong>Note Smart List (All Notes subset)</strong> since <strong>Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> includes a <strong>Dictate Text</strong> action. Note that I could have employed <a href=\"\">Find All Notes HELPER</a>, but: 1) <strong>Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> doesn't need to retrieve <em>all</em> of the notes, and 2) downloading and retaining a <em>helper</em> is somewhat inconvenient.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Unfortunately, will testing of <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5578\">Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</a>, version 2.0, I discovered a <em>second</em> iOS 13.5.1 Shortcuts app bug associated with the <strong>Find Notes</strong> action:</p>\n<p>If a note title (e.g., <strong>My Note ABC</strong>) includes a string (e.g., <strong>ABC</strong>), and the string is deleted from the note title (i.e., changed to <strong>My Note</strong>), the <strong>Find Notes</strong> action will still match that note if the action <em>Filter</em> is: <strong>Name</strong> <em>contains</em> <strong>ABC</strong></p>\n<p>This issue can be circumvented with these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the note, Select All, and Copy the note.</li>\n<li>Delete the note.</li>\n<li>Create a new note and Paste.</li>\n</ol>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1 - June 30, 2020, 1:13 a.m.</strong></p>"}
