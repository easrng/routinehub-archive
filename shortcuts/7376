I have created this because people download broken shortcuts such as Icon Remover even though I have the option to do it. If you want to see a new shortcut that has not submitted yet, please download the latest version. I will add an updater, so this sentence will be deleted when I update. Please note that it might take some time to add working shortcuts. Hope you enjoy!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Nov. 23, 2020, 11:56 a.m.</strong></p><p>• Added QR Code Creator, Open SpringBoard, and Base64 Encoder</p>"}
