You can select and read or save them on your mobile device.</p>\n<p>It subdivides in five parts - <strong>News Bundle, Browse, Topics, Save and Settings</strong><br>\nTo learn more about these wonderful and hard-working sections, you can read these introductions below.</p>\n<p><br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oze0a9h.jpg\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PxzQYc2.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>Advantages</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n<h4>No subscription - all free</h4>\n<p>Shorty News is based on RSS feeds the news sources offer. Everything is free and you do not need to transact a subscriprtion with any news sources.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<h4>No advertising with the detailed view</h4>\n<p>We all know that! Advertising - Everywhere, everytime. It is annoying! So I have tackled the matter and I develop the solution - the News Reader by Shortycuts in Shortcuts, the alternative way is the Safari Reader, which is also available here at Shorty News.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<h4>Privacy and Security</h4>\n<p>The private and data-safe use of Shortycuts' users are guaranteed here as well. Shortycuts will never track your data and save it without your permission.</p>\n<p><code>No liability if any third party providers track user data. Third party providers are Apple Inc. and all news sources in Shorty News. This is not an assumption.</code></p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6PpeXIb.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>News Bundle</h2>\n<p>News Bundle scours well-known news sources in six countries currently. The most recent articles will then be played back to you in an unique vCard menu.\nYou can choose one article and read it with Shortycuts' reader, save it for later, or visit its website.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/49MRj6I.jpg\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br></p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gONjUpn.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>Browse</h2>\n<p>Browse focuses on every news source we offer from your region. If you select a news source, you will be offered up to 30 current articles from its RSS feed. <br>\n<strong>Varied topics are guaranteed here.</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PBprA1l.jpg\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/S4imDTL.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>Topics</h2>\n<p>Topics is a smart way to follow lastest news topics you like based on your specified keywords.<br>\nMaybe <strong>Donald Trump</strong> or <strong>Fridays For Future</strong>?</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong><em>Browse</em></strong> - Browse offers you the opportunity to read articles about a specific topic, but without saving it on your personal <em>Topic favourite list</em> <br><br>\n<strong><em>Add</em></strong> - Here you can add new topics you want to follow to your topic favourite list. <br><br>\n<strong><em>Delete</em></strong> - The opposite of <em>Add</em> is surely <em>Delete</em>. You can delete a topic you don't want to follow anymore from your favourite list here.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Search mechanism</h3>\n<p>The search mechanism is simple to understand: <br>\nIf you search articles about your topic (or keyword), Shorty News will search every news source in your region and its 5 lastest articles. If your topic will be detected in the summary of the news article, Shorty News will suggest you it. If not, then nothing happens.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NK5Z8O3.jpg\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br></p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uv42VSe.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>Save</h2>\n<p>Save is a wonderful way to save news articles offline. If you've found something appealing, you can save it and access it later, even when you're offline.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong><em>Finished reading articles</em></strong> - Offline saved news articles will be shown here. You have everytime and everywhere the access to every saved article until your delete it from your <em>Shorty News Save Gallery</em> <br><br>\n<strong><em>Delete news articles</em></strong> - You can delete your saved news articles here, but attention: If the article is deleted, it will be diffcult to find it again</p>\n<p><br>\n<br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/l1U1nvg.jpg\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br></p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JwIfIz5.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>Shorty News's Reader</h2>\n<h4>Personal. Unique. Beautiful.</h4>\n<p>After you select your article, Shorty News will show yor article in four different designs and in five different fonts, which of course you've already configured beforehand. This will make reading more comfortable.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong><em>Change font size</em></strong> - With Shorty News 2.0 it is possible to change the font size within reading. The sizes are between <strong>13pt*<em> and <strong>40pt</strong>. <br><br>\n</em></strong>Change reader design*** - With Shorty News 2.0 it is also possible to switch the design within reading <br></p>\n<p>But it is important to know that these changes will keep temporarily. The opportunity to keep the changes is going to be implemented soon.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ES4UKUr.jpg\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/17DE0EI.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>ROP's Design</h2>\n<p>You can't find only the ROP's beautiful menu design in his well-known shortcuts like MergeCuts or 1Backup.
