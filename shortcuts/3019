It is also a large community designed to unite pilots, student pilots, flight instructors, air traffic communication enthusiasts, FBO operators, and real-world (and virtual) air traffic controllers. Its target audience is anyone who can learn from or just enjoys listening to or discussing aviation communication topics. The community is supported by volunteers who live within radio range of airports and who use spare radio and computer equipment to relay airband transmissions into the LiveATC.net audio network. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Listen to live streams</li>\n<li>Download feed archives to your iCloud Drive</li>\n<li>Search for feeds by ICAO, IATA or by frequency</li>\n<li>Browse the current top 20 feeds</li>\n<li>Browse feeds based on categories</li>\n<li>Save feeds for quick access</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Uses UpdateKit to stay up to date</li>\n<li>This shortcut is way more complicated than it needs to be </li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - June 22, 2019, 11:28 p.m.</strong></p>"}
