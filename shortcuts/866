If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. I've placed lots of comments throughout to know what happening in the shortcut and help others understand.</p>\n<p>I was asked by a reddit user how I accomplished this. The method I used in a previous shortcut was bloated with actions that do nothing and was throwing me off trying to decipher it. I decided to rewrite it so it was actually useful. Include this in other Shortcuts if this is a function needed.</p>\n<p>If there is a more efficient way to achieve this task, I would love to know. If you have any suggestions, feel free to message me either on reddit, /u/dialup_, on Instagram, @canibeanartist, or here in the feedback form.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Nov. 12, 2018, 3:54 a.m.</strong></p>"}
