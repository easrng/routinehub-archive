As it turns out if you have text you know you want to use as a dictionary or a json you can use this to copy and paste the text as the shortcut asks for it and it will output a formatted JSON or dictionary. </p>\n<p>Right now it allows for single level, array and multi level array (my own terms so sorry if they are wrong). I plan to expand on this in the future but for now use it as is and hopefully it will help you learn or speed up basic creation of this stuff. </p>\n<p>It was tested using Jayson from the App Store to verify that they open and the text structure. </p>\n<p>Side note, it is. Not intended for use to format data from API calls unless you know how to tweak it to account for formatting and parsing or can pull out the text you need via regex and copy/paste.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Aug. 27, 2019, 3:57 a.m.</strong></p>"}
