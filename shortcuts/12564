If you've opted in to using <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/logger-for-shortcuts/id1611554653\">Logger</a> to keep track of your outputs, you might also want to take advantage of the second installation step, which simply prompts you to select a Logger tag for the messages.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Contact</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf\">Contact Card</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://t.me/extratone\">Telegram</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:davidblue@extratone.com\">Email</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NeoYokel\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue\">Mastodon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://discord.gg/0b9KQUKP858b0iZF\">Discord</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://raindrop.io/davidblue/social-directory-21059174\"><em>Everywhere</em></a>...</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - July 15, 2022, 6:47 a.m.</strong></p>"}
