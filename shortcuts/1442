This shortcut generates a direct (MailDrop) link (like Dropbox, OneDrive et cetera.), which you can share via Messages, WhatsApp, Mail and so on. I know there’s a built-in iOS feature to share files with iCloud Drive. But iOS wants you to give access to that file so people can collaborate and work together on that file. You also reveal your identity when you share files in this way. You can bypass this iOS characteristic by using iCloud MailDrop Link.</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<p><img alt=\"iCloud MailDrop Link Mockup\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LUsTI7P.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp; </p>\n<h2>How To</h2>\n<h3>iCloud MailDrop Link uses Apple’s MailDrop technique to generate a direct download link. <em>This is the same what happens when you attach large files to an email and iOS offers you to generate a MailDrop link if the attachment is too large. The recipient of your message will get that link as part of your email.</em></h3>\n<h3>Good to know: iCloud MailDrop Link works directly from the Shortcuts app or via the Share Sheet feature of iOS.</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Steps 1–3\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rkayNEf.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp; </p>\n<h4>1. Select a file from <em>Files</em>.</h4>\n<h4>2. Your personal <em>MailDrop</em> link will be generated and copied to your clipboard.</h4>\n<h4>3. Next, you can share it via <em>Messages, WhatsApp or Mail.</em> In addition, you can share it with other apps like <em>Threema</em> et cetera by tapping the <em>Share</em> button.</h4>\n<h4>4. Another option is to shorten that link before sharing it. <em>MailDrop</em> links are looooong! If you don’t want to use these large links (which could break if you paste it into <em>Messages</em>), simply tap <em>Shorten Link</em> after the <em>MailDrop</em> link has been generated. The link gets shortened by using <em>TinyURL.com</em> and after it will be copied to your clipboard as well.</h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp; </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Steps 4–6\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EoBqrbq.png\"> </p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h2>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h2>\n<p><em>iCloud MailDrop Link</em> has an integrated update mechanism called <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/793\">Embed-a-Update</a>. Thanks to the embedded updater, <em>iCloud MailDrop Link</em> does not require any external updater shortcut.
