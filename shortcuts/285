After a minute of still not being able to find us, we got a FaceTime call which helped us locate him within the store.</p>\n<p>As we were driving home, he says to me, “We should make a shortcut in case you get lost again!”</p>\n<p>So he and I sat down and did just that. This is all built with his input and suggestions. Hopefully I don’t get lost again, though.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Oct. 16, 2018, 3:44 a.m.</strong></p><p>Your not you’re. </p>"}
