Import questions will ask you for the membership end date, Data Jar keypath for the membership period, the price of both membership options and how many visits are included in the alternative membership option. If you try to log a gym visit after the end date, the shortcut will suggest you add a new end date and keypath and take you to the shortcut to make edits.</p>\n<p><strong>———</strong></p>\n<p>(I’m a cheapskate and have a terrible memory so this shortcut helps me keep track of when I actually made it to the gym, but also motivates me to go so I can make the cost per visit as low as possible. Every little thing helps!)</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Oct. 29, 2021, 12:52 a.m.</strong></p>"}
