Inside the new project create two new Headings one \"Domestic\" and one \"International\".\nAlso if you want you can create two new tags one called \"Trip\" and the other \"Trip Organizer\".</p>\n<p>The info you have to provide when the shortcut starts is as follows..\n- Destination of your trip.\n- If it is Domestic or Overseas.\n- Date of the trip.\n- Co-travellers. (You can add as many as you want in the dictionary called \"With\").\n- Items. (You check or uncheck the items to take with you. All items are pre-checked, since you will check most of them anyway. The pre-added items are in greek language , but you can delete those and create your own in the dictionary called \"Items\").</p>\n<p>As always if you have any suggestions please leave a feedback. Enjoy!!\nThank you!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.4 - June 24, 2020, 11:06 p.m.</strong></p><p>- Fixed a bug where you could get URL encoded lines as a result if you choose more than one options in \"With\" dictionary.<br><br>- Implemented an integrated update method. So now you don't need the extra Shortcut \"UpdateKit\". You should keep it though because other Shortcuts may need it.</p>"}
