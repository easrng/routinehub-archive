This shortcut saves a url and the TikTok/URL’s title to a file, organized by name or category. </p>\n<p>The companion shortcut, <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10142/\"><code>Open/Remove Saved TikToks</code></a> is available to open, copy, or edit the saved list.</p>\n<p>To save a TikTok, go to <em>Share</em> → <em>Other</em> → <em>Save TikToks</em>. If you’re having trouble, make sure the shortcut is shown in the Share Sheet (three dots on the shortcut, then three dots in the right upper corner, then “Show in Share Sheet”). </p>\n<p>If you want to add a new user, select “Other” when prompted for which user to save for. <strong>NEW IN 2.00: Save a TikTok to multiple users without running the shortcut multiple times. Simply select the users (or even a new user) when prompted.</strong></p>\n<p>This shortcut saves to and reads from a directory you set up. If, for some reason, you need to change that name, you can access the setup variables in the settings of the shortcut.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.00 - Oct. 6, 2021, 3:36 a.m.</strong></p><p>Updated and rewritten to save each user’s TikToks in a different file (to speed up reading and writing) and to allow you to see a list of existing users you’ve created and then choose one or more to save to.</p>"}
