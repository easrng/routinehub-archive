Although you don’t have to — I’m personally a fan of connecting an iPad to a TV and drawing on the iPad with an Apple Pencil, but this shortcut works with paper and pencil as well!</p>\n<p>Contains almost 400 words, but it doesn’t have categories like real Pictionary. </p>\n<p>In real pictionary you win by reaching the end of a game board that has 55 places. You move each round by a roll of 1 die. This is why the shortcut version is 55 points to win, and why it rolls a die.</p>\n<p>Requires Toolbox Pro, but just the free version.</p>\n<p>Running iOS 13? Try version 2.4. It’s the last compatible update.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.6 - Oct. 17, 2020, 4:32 a.m.</strong></p><p>Version 2.6 automatically checks for updates the first time it’s run each day. It’s a feature I should’ve added long before now, but it’s here now. The pop up telling you about the update won’t interfere with gameplay in any way. Manually checking for updates is still supported.</p>"}
