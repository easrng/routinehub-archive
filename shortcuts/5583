After logging one note for the day, she won't ask again until the next day</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cari will ask if she can play something for you. If you say yes, she will ask you what you want to hear (via Apple Music) and she can also resume whatever you were listening to previously by saying \"Resume\" (this also works for podcasts). Based on your response she will start playing the music found (playlists are also included, just say something like, \"Play my Rock playlist\" or \"Rock Playlist\" or even \"Play my playlist Rock Music\")</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>New in 1.4</strong> you can now tell Cari to play \"Podcast\" and she will resume from your last playing podcast in any of the following players</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple Podcasts </li>\n<li>Castbox</li>\n<li>Overcast</li>\n<li>Pocket Casts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cari will then start the navigation to the location specified from the beginning of the interaction (if you said yes of course)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lastly, she will provide you with a brief weather report for your current location</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> to avoid hearing weather, reminders, and calendar events each time you get in your car in a short time period, each of these items has a \"cool down\" time</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Calendar Events - 1 hour</li>\n<li>Reminders - 2 hours</li>\n<li>Weather - 1.5 hours</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Update checks are also limited to once every 24 hours to reduce loading time</p>\n<h6>The ideal method for activation of Cari, is using the \"When CarPlay Connects\" automation type (phone must not be locked when triggered). Usage of the \"NFC\" automation type is also a great way to invoke Cari.</h6>\n<p><img alt=\"Made by mvan231\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8hLBxmo.jpg\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911\"><img alt=\"Graphics created with MediaKit\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/j1bSp3J.png\"></a></p>\n<p>Credit goes out to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ROP</strong> For MediaKit Badges, Banners, and MediaKit for the images used in this page</li>\n<li><strong>PaRkThEcAr</strong> For ideas and feedback during development <ul>\n<li>Inspiration for Cari stemmed from his shortcut, <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3859\">Let's Go</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.5 - Oct. 20, 2020, 11:15 p.m.</strong></p><p>Version 1.5 Release Notes<br>- Fix for Castbox if statement.
