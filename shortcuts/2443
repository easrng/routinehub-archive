Instructions are in comments in the shortcut, or <strong>go to <a href=\"https://jake.cat/shortcuts\">jake.cat/shortcuts</a> for a simple guide</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: this will leave your current status emoji untouched.</strong> The Slack API requires a text emoji to update it (e.g. <code>:heart_eyes_cat:</code>) and there's not a good way to choose an emoji or have the user type one within Shortcuts. Feel free to amend the shortcut as needed if you want to have a list of emoji to choose from as well.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.3 - Sept. 25, 2020, 8:23 p.m.</strong></p><p>Minor fix</p>"}
