Sorry. Let's hope that this will be fixed in iOS 16.  </li>\n<li>I made any effort to localize/internationalize the script, but there are some issues with Siri that can be troublesome for some configurations. Not all language are supported by the TTS, and some of them have to be configured manually in the script. It is not too hard, just look for the action labeled \"Read (something)\" for your language, and expanding the options you will be able to select the language and the voice directly.  </li>\n<li>There are other two settings in Siri TTS that cannot be configured without editing the script directly: the speed ('<em>rate</em>') and the tone ('<em>pitch</em>') of the voice. I tried to set those for best result, but if you don't like them you can change them in the same place of the language settings.  </li>\n<li>Siri has a known issue with the \"-\" character and some others: no pause between words. So I fixed this adding a semicolon and a new line after each one of them to force a pause, and it should be ok now.</li>\n<li>Sometimes the cached data can become corrupted, especially in case of errors during the execution. If you experience a problem after an abrupt stop of the shortcut, try deleting the <strong>cache</strong> folder (under: <em>~‚Å®iCloud Drive‚Å© / ‚Å®Shortcuts‚Å© / ‚Å®read_epub_aloud‚Å© / cache / </em>) and try again.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>REQUIREMENTS</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>You need the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/ao/app/a-shell-mini/id1543537943\">a-Shell Mini</a> app installed.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>INFO</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>2022-07-08 v1.0.4  </li>\n<li>Author: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fremenmuaddib/\">u/fremenmuaddib</a>  </li>\n<li>This shortcut is canonically available on RoutineHub at https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12422/</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.4 - July 8, 2022, 5:21 a.m.</strong></p><p>- fixed some minor issues with the python script</p>"}
