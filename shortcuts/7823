Videos can be downloaded at up to <strong>1080x1920@60fps</strong> (most apps are limited at 720x1280@30fps). It’s fast and works with app and web on iPhone and iPad. You can also download media from <strong>private</strong> accounts that you follow.</p>\n<p>iOS 14 or later, the free <strong><em><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1405459188\">Scriptable</a></em></strong> and <strong><em><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1543537943\">a-Shell mini</a></em></strong> apps are required. On iOS 15, you can use <em>a-Shell</em> (much bigger) instead of <em>a-Shell mini</em>.</p>\n<h2>How to Use</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Tap the ‘<strong>···</strong>’ button on the top right corner of a post or story, select ‘Share to’ then <em>Instagram Download</em> and it will save the media onto your photo album.<ul>\n<li>If ‘Share to’ is not available, you can ‘Copy Link’, run <em>Instagram Download</em> from the <em>Shortcuts</em> app, and choose ‘Download media from copied link’.</li>\n<li>You can download private stories by copying the profile url and running <em>Instagram Download</em> from the <em>Shortcuts</em> app.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>On web, use the browser’s share button instead of the ‘<strong>···</strong>’ button.</li>\n<li>Private stories can also be downloaded from web.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Yinr6WB.png\"></p>\n<p><em>Instagram</em> limits how many times within a certain period of time a device can access its server without logging in. That’s why previous versions, as well as many other shortcuts, either switch to a browser or fail for a while and come back to normal repeatedly, because they access Instagram without logging in when shared from the Instagram app. This shortcut keeps you logged in thanks to <em>Scriptable</em> that maintains web cookies across its webview and http request sessions automatically for you. In short, it works all the time within the app without hiccups.</p>\n<h2>User Settings</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You can change user settings by running <em>Instagram Download</em> from the <em>Shortcuts</em> app.</li>\n<li>You can check logged-in account or switch accounts.</li>\n<li>To change folder or album, toggle the <em>Save to Files/Photos</em> option off and on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GbIIJbE.png\"></p>\n<h2>Grid View?</h2>\n<p>The <em>Shortcuts</em> app shows a list of images in grid view, and a list of media containing videos in list view. The ‘Show Videos in Grid View’ option enables grid view even for media containing videos.</p>\n<h2>What about Higher Quality Videos?</h2>\n<p>In early December 2021, <em>Instagram</em> started reducing the quality of some videos viewed on <strong>web</strong>; it had been the same quality regardless of web or app before. Although this shortcut is based on <em>Scriptable</em>‘s Web View, it is able to download app-quality videos. However, it needs a powerful media editing tool like <em>ffmpeg</em> included in <em>a-Shell mini</em> because high quality videos have separate audio files.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>3.0.4 - Aug. 19, 2022, 9 a.m.</strong></p><p>2022-08-19<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Fix for private story highlights<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Major fixes for Arabic users (من فضلك أخبرني إذا وجدت أي مشكلة)</p>"}
