This shortcut will prompt you for the amount of $NANO you want to split. It will then generate a PDF with QR codes that you can later scan with your favorite $NANO wallet to make the transactions. Before you run this shortcut you must make a list in the “Reminders” app. Each reminder in that list must contain only one NANO address. Add as many addresses as you like. If you enjoy this shortcut please don’t exclude the final QR code from your splits.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Sept. 13, 2021, 9:05 a.m.</strong></p>"}
