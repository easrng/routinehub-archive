Here is how it works:</p>\n<p>You guys send me an email by pressing the envelope button on my profile page with your video (must be from Dropbox with sharing on), video information and your username, then I copy the link and add it into my shortcut for others to watch. Please note that I watch every video I get before I upload it to the shortcut, if it has any swears or is not related to gaming, it will not be added into the shortcut. Also, this project is in its alpha stage so please let me know what you think. There is also a sample video from YouTube by the user Gegcoin.
