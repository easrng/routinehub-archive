Here's a step-by-step of how to set up the shortcut!</p>\n<p>This shortcut by default supports 8 different wallpapers, and you can have separate wallpapers for your home and lock screen.</p>\n<p>I've chosen the Big Sur wallpapers for myself, and you can download all versions of each dynamic wallpaper <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2020/10/28/macos-big-sur-11-0-1-includes-even-more-new-wallpapers-download-them-here/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>These instructions will be assuming that you have two different devices</strong> (like an iPad and iPhone) <strong>and you want different wallpapers on your home and lock screen.</strong></p>\n<h1>Step 1</h1>\n<p>You have now downloaded 16 images. I've chosen <em>The Lake</em> and <em>The Beach</em>.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/ncelclg7nvz51.png?width=1571&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13d5176f1d1b680dfa5ca1adc343a0213af8a5a6\">\nAs you can see, I've added all 16 photos to a folder in iCloud Drive. You'll also notice that I've edited the names.</p>\n<p>You will need to add a <strong>prefix</strong> and an <strong>identifier</strong> to the title. I have chosen a number as my prefix, and the name of the location as my identifier.</p>\n<p>Assuming you do the same, here's how to setup the names:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You have two sets of images. One will go on your lock screen, and the other will go on your home screen. I want <code>The Beach</code> on my home screen and <code>The Lake</code> on my lock screen. Make sure that this identifier is in each image of that location. This makes it so the shortcut can differentiate between each set of backgrounds. The identifier can be anywhere within the name as long as it is not at the beginning.</li>\n<li>There are 8 images for each set. Use the number prefix to tell the shortcut which time you want the image to be set as your wallpaper. For example, put a <code>1</code> at the beginning of the name for the <code>7:00 AM</code> image for both <code>The Beach</code> and <code>The Lake</code>. There should be only two images with the same prefix, and they should be from different locations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Place all 16 files in a folder. Put this folder in the Shortcuts folder inside iCloud Drive.</p>\n<p>Now, you're ready to set up the shortcut!</p>\n<h1>Step 2</h1>\n<p>Open the link at the top of this post to add the shortcut. Scroll to the bottom and tap <code>Add Untrusted Shortcut</code> and answer the questions. I'll walk you through what each one means:\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/mi14ijkcnvz51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1136523ffaab8c6bd4260b280aab26a69472786\">\nYou'll get this question 8 times, one for each time of the day you want the wallpaper to change. Right now, you need to type the time you want the first wallpaper to be added. Make sure you type it in the proper format.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/62g29vifnvz51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddabaa54be9f873e55c8a416b78cae1bccac9e78\">\nNext, you need to type the prefix for the wallpapers you want at that time. Type the prefix here, and nothing else. You will need to do this each time you set a time (which will be 8 times)\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/uvg8gesinvz51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e9e4152651490006d734ea4cc8b5cd7d8fbf096\">\nEventually you will get to this step. Assuming you simply put the folder containing your images directly in the Shortcuts folder in iCloud Drive, you can simply type the name of the folder. I named my folder <code>BGD Images</code> so that is what I typed.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/g14pnlklnvz51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14534531a3000bed9e4325a6a25cb952dbf231a7\">\nAt this step, the shortcut will determine your device's model. This is simply <code>iPhone</code>, <code>iPad</code>, etc. If you don't know your device's model, create a new shortcut with the action <code>Get Device Details</code> and select <code>Device Model</code>.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/lp2h2pronvz51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=529a391547edc7d139be2274c81d8d8e84f6a62c\">\nIn the next step, you'll need to determine the size you want the image to be for that device. You can use <a href=\"http://iosres.com\">this website</a> to determine the maximum size allowed for your device. <strong>Make sure that the width and height you choose are proportional to the original image, or your wallpaper will be distorted.</strong> The images I have are square, but my phone's screen is not. I want the maximum size for my phone, so I set <em>both</em> sides of the resized image to be equal to the shorter side of the phone. If I set them both to the longer side of the phone, the image will be too large and you'll get an error message.</p>\n<p>My iPad has more pixels so on the next step you can set the dimensions for a second device. If you don't have a second device, you can leave that step blank.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/d11j2xnqnvz51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f35ca0ff1747ef7d8b8121b11d1f254fe525dd3\">\nNow, we need to type the identifier for the Home Screen wallpaper set. Since I want the beach location on my home screen, and there is the word <code>Beach</code> in each image of that location, that is what I type here.</p>\n<p>The next step will be for your Lock Screen identifier, so I would type <code>Lake</code>.</p>\n<p>At this point, you are done setting up the shortcut. Now, we need to add automations:</p>\n<h1>Step 3</h1>\n<p>Open the Automation tab in your shortcuts app. For each time that you added while setting up the shortcut, create the following automation:\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/0rep78dtnvz51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f069f07b83d7baf7271138f4a12c96c11730aaaa\">\nYou'll make 8 of these, and make sure that they are at the same times that you entered when you were setting up the shortcut. If an automation runs at a time that was not specified in the shortcut, it won't change the wallpaper automatically.</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<h1>Running the shortcut manually</h1>\n<p>Yes, you can run it manually. If you do this and it is not one of the times specified, it will prompt you to select an image. This will be your home screen image, and at the second prompt you will choose your lock screen image.</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<h1>Changing the image</h1>\n<p>Just replace the images in the folder with your new images, and remember to name them properly!</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<h1>Editing the shortcut</h1>\n<p>You might want to do this to fit it to your needs.
