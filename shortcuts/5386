They are presented as a nice looking menu with album covers and release dates. Just tap on an item to open it in the Spotify app. The shortcut is using the official <a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/browse/get-list-new-releases/\">Spotify Web API</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> This shortcut depends on two other additional shortcuts which you need to <strong>download first</strong> in order to make it work:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5383\">Spotify Get Search Token </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5385\">Spotify Build Menu List From Album Items </a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please download these two shortcuts beforehand and make sure to follow the instructions from <strong>1.</strong>! </p>\n<p>You'll need both <a href=\"https://datajar.app\">DataJar</a> and <a href=\"https://toolboxpro.app\">Toolbox Pro</a> to get this shortcut to work. DataJar makes it easy and secure to store all Spotify API credentials and the tokens will be reused as long as they are valid. Toolbox Pro helps to create a nice looking menu with album cover art. </p>\n<p>The shortcut supports pagination, just click on the \"...more\" button to get the next results. To customise the search results you might want to add your Spotify country code (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2\">ISO 3166-1</a>) inside your DataJar dictionary as well: <strong>spotifyApi.country</strong> (e.g. US or GB).</p>\n<p><strong>Preview:</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"screenshot\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5NKNgVf.png\"></p><p></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.2 - May 24, 2020, 3:56 p.m.</strong></p><p>- omit country if it is not defined in DataJar <br>- improved error handling</p>"}
