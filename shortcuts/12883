{"id":"12883","name":"Ubuntu VPN Gateway","tagline":"VPN Gateway","icon":"ios15 c3031607807 g59722","latest":"34755","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Ever wanted a router with VPN Client functionality? Can't justify the cost of a router with this feature?</p>\n<p>Look no further! If you've got an old computer collecting dust in a cupboard, now could be the time to put it to use once again.</p>\n<p>For this project, I am using Ubuntu Server 22.04 on a Raspberry Pi 4. So running on low powered unit which is best with cost of living and all that!</p>\n<p>You'll need resolvconf, iptables-persistent, wireguard and openvpn installed for full use of this. </p>\n<p>You'll need to edit /etc/sysctl.conf for net ipv4 forwarding and add some iptables, after which you'll install iptables-persistent.</p>\n<p>Anyway, less of that and more on what this shortcut does or can do for you. </p>\n<p>Please acknowledge this as more of a template, however you can modify to suit your needs. </p>\n<p>In a nutshell, this shortcut will allow you to do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Connect to a VPN server, you're presented with list of providers, you choose a server which will be based on either OpenVPN or Wireguard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Disconnect from VPN. This ensures OpenVPN and Wireguard sessions are terminated. Useful for if you simply don't want a VPN active. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check VPN status which will show Wireguard status or OpenVPN logs. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Confirm IP, ISP, City, Country details of your internet connection. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reboot server. What machine doesn't throw a wobbler from time to time?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My use case here: To be able to use a VPN on devices that don't support VPN clients. Such devices like Apple TV, PlayStation, some not to Smart TV's to name a few. </p>\n<p>So I set Gateway on my devices to be that of my Ubuntu VPN server and then it makes use of whatever VPN I'm connected to.</p>\n<p>I hope that some of you can make use of this and adapt to your needs.</p>\n<p>Note, configs stored in users home folder, typically /home/user. In there are names of VPN providers. This case, we note vpn_unlimited which is a folder within and contains two folders, one named wireguard, one named openvpn. These folder contain the .conf and .ovpn files respectively. The files are named city/region_country. Those files are copied to locations where default interface names for Wireguard and OpenVPN exist. See shortcut paths and you'll get the idea.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Aug. 30, 2022, 7:22 p.m.</strong></p><p>Added Ookla Speed Test<br><br>Added options for viewing current configs of both OpenVPN (tun0.ovpn) and Wireguard configs (wg0.conf). Useful for troubleshooting configs and making sure files are copying to destination folder. <br><br>Added kill OpenVPN connection and Wireguard connection on each VPN server connection. That way, you can be sure there is no active VPN connection prior to starting new one.</p>"}
