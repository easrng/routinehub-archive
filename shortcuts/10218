Note that installing every single plugin causes the app to crash when viewing workshops, not sure which one was the culprit. Since most of my game time was clocked pre-dfhack and I’m not very familiar with it, I’ve only used this for exploratory mining designations with the dig plugin’s <code>digexp diag5r</code>command, no guarantees about any other plugins’ functionality.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Sept. 27, 2021, 3:46 a.m.</strong></p>"}
