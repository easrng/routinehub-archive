It is also the fastest, using a-Shell and the du command.  </p>\n<h1>How it works</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Open the shortcut and select the folder you want to measure.   </li>\n<li>The shortcut will use a-Shell and the 'du' command to get the apparent total size of a folder (and also of its files and subfolders, including invisible elements).  </li>\n<li>Then it will show you a pretty HTML table with the total size followed by the other elements, sorted by size. You can copy, export or print it.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Companions</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>If you need to compute the size of a group of files, you can use my other shortcut <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12642/\"><strong>Total Size Of Files</strong></a>.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>REQUIREMENTS</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>You need the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/ao/app/a-shell-mini/id1543537943\">a-Shell Mini</a> app installed.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h1>\n<p>I wish to thank his excellency <a href=\"https://github.com/holzschu\"><strong>Nicolas Holzschuch</strong></a> (the genius developer of <em>a-Shell</em>) for his precious suggestions about how to overcome some troublesome pickFolder limitations with a <a href=\"https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell/issues/423#issuecomment-1173069807\">clever trick</a>  </p>\n<h1>INFO</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>2022-07-04 v1.0.1  </li>\n<li>Author: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fremenmuaddib/\">u/fremenmuaddib</a>  </li>\n<li>This shortcut is canonically available on RoutineHub at https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12460/</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.1 - July 4, 2022, 2:02 a.m.</strong></p><p>- fixed a small typo in the comment.</p>"}
