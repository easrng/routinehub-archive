It also fills any 'extra' space able e and below the image with a color scape that compliments the image.</p>\n<p>This is useful if you are using external images for your backgrounds, and do not know the ratio of the image, or if you are using the same scripts to set backgrounds on iPhones and iPads.</p>\n<p>If the script is given 1 image, the same image is used for both the Lock Screen and the Home Screen. If it is given more than 1 image, it will use the first as the Lock Screen, and the last as the Home Screen. It will do processing on each image, so it is wasteful to provide more than 2 images a this point.</p>\n<p>See the discussion below for example scripts that call this script.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.7 - Jan. 2, 2021, 8:36 p.m.</strong></p>"}
