Team Members is a dictionary and each team member is a dictionary with Keys for First_Name, Last_Name, etc. One of those Keys must be “Photo” with a value for “Photo” in which a file is attached. If there is no entry for Photo for one of the Team Members, there is a base64 encoded default image that will be used. You can use one of a variety of \"Merge\" shortcuts to insert this snippet into your Shortcut.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Data Jar Setup\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XSbGtGU.jpg\" title=\"Data Jar Setup\"></p>\n<h2>Using the Snippet</h2>\n<p>With this snippet, you can then use that selected item to pull out specific data from Data Jar. In this example, I run the shortcut and choose which Data Jar Key to use (Team Members). This brings up a rich menu with each Team Member and their photo. I then pull out their First Name using a Data Jar Team Members.Selected Team Member.First_Name_ action, but you can do anything you wanted using the selected item.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Rich TBP Menus from DJ in action\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/RcTmdmo.jpg\" title=\"Rich TBP Menus from DJ in action\"></p>\n<h2>Updater Info</h2>\n<p>This snippet uses my TBP Updater snippet (<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5692\">https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5692</a>) for version control. It uses free Toolbox Pro actions and is a lightweight updater from RouteineHub. The Updater ends at Nothing, so you can remote if you prefer another one or none at all.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - June 24, 2020, 3:36 a.m.</strong></p>"}
