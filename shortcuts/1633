If you prefer Google Chrome, remove the 'Open URLs' action and replace it with the 'Open URLs in Chrome' action.</li>\n<li>This Shortcut was tested using the official Reddit app and the Apollo Reddit app, but should work for all Reddit apps via their 'Share' function.</li>\n<li>If a Post or Comment shows '[removed]' or '[removed too quickly to be archived]', it was likely caught by an AutoModerator filter before it could be archived by Pushshift.io, and is uncontrollable.</li>\n<li>If a Post or Comment shows '[deleted]', it was likely deleted by the original author and re-archived by Pushshift.io, and is uncontrollable.</li>\n<li>If a Post or Comment has been edited, some results will be the original, unedited version, and some will be the edited version. This depends entirely on if Pushshift.io has re-archived the Post or Comment, and is uncontrollable.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Bugs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sometimes a URL for a Subreddit will be falsely identified as a Post or Comment.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>If you improve on this Shortcut, please drop me a PM on Reddit. I am always ready to improve myself. Thanks!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - Jan. 27, 2019, 7:48 a.m.</strong></p><p>Squashed a bug where a trailing '/' on a short link would cause the shortcut to fail.</p>"}
