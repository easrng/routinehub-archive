There's 2 ways to use it.</p>\n<p><strong>Method 1: Just run the shortcut</strong><br>\nRun the shortcut, choose the contact that you want to generate a QR code of, and that's it! You get a scan-able QR code.</p>\n<p><strong>Method 2: Run from the share sheet</strong><br>\nGo to the Phone app or Contacts app, find a contact (recent callers works too), click <em>Share Contact</em> and choose QRContacts!</p>\n<h2>Limitations</h2>\n<p>Shortcuts can only generate QR codes up to 1000 characters<strong>*</strong> (or even less in other languages) without getting the code distorted. So don't blame me when you can't scan the generated code because it's distorted.</p>\n<p><strong>*</strong> This is an estimated number, it sometimes goes higher or lower than that.</p>\n<h4>Updater support</h4>\n<p>This shortcut supports <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2692\">Swing Updater</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2692\"><img alt=\"Swing Updater Badge\" src=\"https://d3w10.netlify.com/routinehub/su/Swing%20Updater%20Badge.png\"></a></p>\n<p>37 actions.<br>\nDescription updated 2020-10-14.  </p>\n<hr>\n<h2>License</h2>\n<p>You are not allowed to distribute unmodified versions of this shortcut without permission.<br>\nUse the RoutineHub link when recommending this shortcut to others.</p>\n<p>You are allowed to modify the shortcut, integrate the shortcut in another shortcut and publish a modified version or the integrated shortcut with credits to Rico Ip or SoNothing, either inside the shortcut or the description of the publishing platform.</p>\n<h4>Super short summary:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>No reposts.</li>\n<li>If you make another version or integrate my shortcut, credit me when posting.</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.1.2 - Dec. 27, 2019, 5:16 p.m.</strong></p><p>* Fixed Swing update info </p>"}
