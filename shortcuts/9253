So I created a shortcut that creates a numbered list from an article or blog or whatever you're reading.  </p>\n<p>Quicklist helps you quickly organize text into a list from anywhere.  QuickList can parse text by space, lines or any custom character you like.  Let's say you found an iteresting blog about 11 steps to health.  However you would like to itemize only the step titles to put in a reminder.  Highlight the whole block of text you like.  Share to QuickList parse by lines, QuickList will present a list of text you can select all the lines you wish to keep, it then itemizes them with a number prefix 1-11, copies it to the clipboard.  Now it's ready for you to paste anywhere youd like.  </p>\n<p>Update the parsing parameter in the shortut setting.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - May 28, 2021, 10:06 a.m.</strong></p>"}
