Also works on Apple TV as long as you AirPlay, so it works with any AirPlay device whether that be HomePod, Sonos speaker etc.</p>\n<p>Now as long as you keep this shortcut running in the foreground (on the screen) it should announce every song as it starts/changes.</p>\n<p>You have to have your auto lock in Settings&gt;Display&gt;Brightness set to never to get this to work, hopefully things will change as Shortcuts is updated in the future.
