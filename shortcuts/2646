{"id":"2646","name":"AVoid 5","tagline":"Assists you in typing without using that fifth symbol of our ABCs","icon":"ios13 c4251333119 g59798","latest":"16715","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>So you know that symbol that sits amid \"D\" and \"F\" in our ABCs (and \"W\" and \"R\" on most typing boards)? r/AVoid5 is a subforum in which all of us as a community avoid that filthy symbol, from this point forward known as \"fifthglyph\". Anybody can post about anything as long as fifthglyph is totally missing. This is no trivial task, but a skill. It can look daunting at first, but you'll find it's not so bad.</p>\n<h4>What is this Shortcut for?</h4>\n<p>This Shortcut will assist you in typing on iOS without using fifthglyph at all. That subforum I was talking about disallows it, and you don't want to slip up. It will fix your words that you supply it.</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Finish typing it all out</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Highlight your words</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tap your words</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tap that button that has a fifthglyph in it and a \"...\" at its finish</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tap \"AVoid 5\" (this Shortcut)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Follow any instructions it shows</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At its finish your fifthglyph missing submission is on your clipboard</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>You can also run this Shortcut straight from your Shortcuts app and it will ask you if you want to \"Obtain From Clipboard\" or \"Start From Scratch\".</em></p>\n<h4>Why should you join our community?</h4>\n<p>Fifthglyph is far too common among our vocabulary, barging its way into so many words willy-nilly. It arrogantly thinks nobody can function without it, that it's \"too big to fail\". Joining this community of humans that don't say fifthglyph is a way of standing up against that symbol.</p>\n<p>It's also just a fun thing to do. It's a trial for your brain to think of ways to say things that don't contain any fifthglyphs.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2.0 - May 2, 2020, 9:09 p.m.</strong></p><p>Full support for iOS 13</p>"}
