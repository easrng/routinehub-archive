You can use this address to test your application. We do every effort to protect your anonymity and do not collect or log any personal details. </p>\n<p>It's simple, having an anonymous email address can really come in handy when you're forced to \"opt in\" to receive something that you're not sure you'll continue using.  Temporary mail works like any other, but with some differences: It's short-lived - from a few minutes to a few days. Your temporary address can be used anywhere where you do not expect to receive important information.</p>\n<h2>More information</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://tempmailo.com/bl/where-who-and-how-to-use-temp-mail\">Where to use temp email</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tempmailo.com/bl/temporary-email-ord-disposable-email-service\">Temporary Email or Disposable Email Service</a></li>\n</ol>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Dec. 31, 2020, 12:43 a.m.</strong></p><p>Initial version</p>"}
