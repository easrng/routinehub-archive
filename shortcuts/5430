These 3 different values are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimistic Value (O)</li>\n<li>Pessimistic Value (P)</li>\n<li>Most Likely Value (M)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are two popular methods to arrive at the Expected Value (Mean).</p>\n<h1>Simple Average</h1>\n<p>It is based on Triangular Distribution. The Mean can be determined by the following formula.</p>\n<p>E_SA=(O+P+M)/3</p>\n<h1>PERT Formula</h1>\n<p>PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) is calculated using a Weighted Average. It is based on Beta Distribution. The Mean can be determined by the following formula.</p>\n<p>E_PERT=(O+P+4Ã—M)/6</p>\n<h2>Reduced Risk</h2>\n<p>A 3-Point Estimation can be done using either Simple Average or PERT Formula. It improves the Estimation accuracy and reduces Project Risk. It provides a better result than just a Single Point Estimate</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1 - May 30, 2020, 7:36 a.m.</strong></p>"}
