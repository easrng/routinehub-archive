Insert a preferred code as your security code.</li>\n<li>It will prompt you to restart the shortcut. Do so then run again.</li>\n<li>Enter your code. Now it will prompt you to enter your home network’s password (Your password is greatly protected and hidden.)</li>\n<li>It will also restart the shortcut. Enter security code again then your setup is finished!</li>\n</ol>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.04 - July 1, 2019, 2:30 a.m.</strong></p><p>Finalised UpdateKit</p>"}
