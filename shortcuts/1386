It is the de facto \"standard\" for creating template projects on the Mac. </p>\n<p>I used Curt's script for years, but it always bugged me that I had to be at my laptop to make a project.  Then, a few months ago I found Rosemary Orchard's workflow <a href=\"https://colterreed.com/how-to-fill-out-omnifocus-project-templates-with-workflow\">Omnifocus Project Templates</a> which recreates the same functionality on iOS.</p>\n<p>It was all good until the day when I needed to create a template that was shared with a coworker. After several rounds of emailing back and forth every time one of us made a change to the template, I decided there had to be a better way to do shared templates. Thus the idea for this workflow was born.</p>\n<p>Now all of our shared templates (currently only 1, but we could just as easily have 500) live in a shared Dropbox folder, and if one of us makes a change, everyone sees it instantly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>How It Works</h3>\n<p>Similar to Curt's script, this shortcut allows you to select a template you have previously created and instantiate a project from it. If your template contains any «variables», the script will ask you what you would like to replace them with.</p>\n<p><em>NOTE: Variables can only contain letters and numbers, no white space or punctuation.</em></p>\n<p><strong>What you will need:</strong><br>\nA Dropbox or iCloud folder containing Taskpaper formatted template files. (Shortcuts requires a .txt extension) </p>\n<p>If you are not familiar with Taskpaper format, there are a few options to make the process of creating the templates easier.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OmniFocus offers the option to copy any project to the clipboard in Taskpaper format. You can then paste it into a text editor and make the necessary tweaks to generalize it.</li>\n<li>For those of you that use <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471\">Drafts 5</a> on iOS, Rosemary Orchard has created a <a href=\"https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/using-drafts-5-taskpaper-with-omnifocus\">Taskpaper Action Group</a> that makes working with these files much easier.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Targeting:</strong> <br>\nBecause I usually want my templates to put the resulting project into a certain folder, I have added an option to support targeting where to create the project.</p>\n<p>If you would like to target a specific folder, put it in the first line of your template in this format: \n</p><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; Folder Name</pre><p></p>\n<p>If the first line does not start with &gt;&gt;&gt;, or the specified folder cannot be found, the project will be created top-level instead.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I type the « » ?</strong><br>\nMacOS: [ option + \\ ] and [ option + shift + \\ ]<br>\niOS: long press [ \" ]</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Example Template</h3>\n<p>When instantiating the project below, you would be prompted for vales for «Topic» and «PubDate». The project would then be created with provided values, and placed under the \"My Blog\" folder.</p>\n<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; My Blog\nBlog post on «Topic» @parallel(false) @autodone(true)\n    - Research «Topic» @tags(online)\n    - Draft «Topic» post @tags(writing, focused)\n    - Proof «Topic» post @parallel(false) @autodone(true)\n        - Send post to editor for proofing @tags(communicate, people : editor) @due(«PubDate» -3d)\n        - Waiting on: response from editor WRT «Topic» post @tags(waiting on, people : editor)\n        - Finalize any edits on «Topic» post @tags(focused) @due(«PubDate» -2d)\n    - Publish «Topic» post @parallel(true) @autodone(true) @due(«PubDate» -1d)\n        - Schedule «Topic» post to go live on «PubDate»\n        - Schedule Facebook post for «Topic» on «PubDate»\n</pre>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot of the resulting project, given that «Topic» = Siri Shortcuts, and «PubDate» = Jan 4<br>\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/1yCRA2B\">Link to image</a></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: I don't actually have a blog, so I have no idea if this is actually a valid process for a post.
