When run, it will ask for the title of the movie you’re seeing, ex “First Man” (<em>entered without quotes</em>). The shortcut then asks when you’re seeing the movie, and using the runtime of the movie, is able to calculate when the movie will end (with 15 minutes added for trailers). A menu will ask which theater you plan on going to (<em>configured upon import</em>).

The end time is provided by the calculation mentioned above, and the plot of the film is entered in the notes.</p>\n<p><strong>You will need to register for an API Key at http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx</strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.03 - Oct. 22, 2018, 4:14 a.m.</strong></p><p>Updated comments.</p>"}
