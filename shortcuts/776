Inputting these into my calendar manually then each time was a huge hassle, so I decided to help automate it with a shortcut, and figured other people may be interested in such a thing as well.</p>\n<p>*Optional Notes, if enabled from import questions, will default to prompting an input box for what to put as the note. You can edit the shortcut as you wish to change this functionality to a preset note every time, or even something more complex, like selecting options from a list. You can easily find the section to edit as it's marked by a comment with a brief description on the note.</p>\n<p>Automatic Updates are powered by UpdateKit &amp; RoutineHub. You will need UpdateKit v2.0 or higher for them to work, although if you don't have UpdateKit at all, it just won't check for updates ever.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - Dec. 7, 2018, 4:01 a.m.</strong></p><p>- Fixed an issue where it wouldn’t tell you what was added to the calendar in some situations, instead asking if you skipped stuff. This also removes the notice that it’s added nothing, instead just showing a blank section for what was added. <br>- NOTE: Updating to this version will erase any changes and personal info from your current version of the shortcut. You’ll have to redo the changes and input your info again.</p>"}
