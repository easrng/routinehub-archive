You can add a location when you install the shortcut and receive notifications for each item on your list when you arrive at the location - You don't have to open reminders or any app, simply look at your phone and dismiss the notifications or mark as completed by force-touching the notification.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.6 - Dec. 1, 2018, 10:22 a.m.</strong></p><p>Adds prompt to choose a reminder list</p>"}
