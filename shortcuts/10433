It will not repeat any wallpapers until it has run through every image in the album, and it even makes sure not to pick the same wallpaper twice in a row when starting over after using every image. Works great when run manually or as an automation to change your wallpaper every day/week/month/etc.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Dec. 3, 2021, 2:25 p.m.</strong></p><p>Updated setup to choose whether to set the wallpaper to the Home Screen, Lock Screen, or both.</p>"}
