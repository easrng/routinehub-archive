Unlike most shortcut map games, <strong>Lost</strong> uses a combination of shortcuts, to display the data and JavaScript, to manipulate the data. These two coding languages come together to make a fast and reliable shortcut game. This is also the first shortcut to introduce a scrolling map instead of a fixed map for a game.</p>\n<h2>How To Play</h2>\n<p>The goal of the game is simple; survive as long as possible. The length of time you survive is marked in days. Each day consists of 4 actions. You use an action whenever you move or do other actions like fishing. </p>\n<p>You will start the game at a random spot on the map with 15 health, 2 food, and 4 actions. After each day you will have to eat a food. If you don't have any you lose 3 health. </p>\n<p>To find food you will have to find berries (🫐), find rabbits (🐇), or fish.</p>\n<p>The map will scroll with each movement. You will always be able to see 4 tiles on all sides of you, creating a 9x9 grid. The map is 30x30 and includes 900 tiles. Around the map, you will find ⬛️. ⬛️ are the walls of the map and you will not be able to pass them.</p>\n<h2>About The Tiles</h2>\n<h3>⬛️ Wall (0)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You cannot move onto a wall tile</li>\n<li>Wall tiles mark the border of the map</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🟩 Grass (1)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The standard tile</li>\n<li>You will always spawn on a grass tile</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🟦 Water (2)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You cannot move onto a water tile</li>\n<li>You can fish if you are beside water</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🌲 Tree (3)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When on a tree tile, you will lose 1 extra action</li>\n<li>There is a chance that an event could occur if you are on a forest tile</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🪨 Rock (r)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You cannot move onto a rock tile</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🌱 Plant (a)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Plant tiles spawn randomly on a grass tile (🟩)</li>\n<li>Plant tiles have a chance to grow into a bush tile (🌳)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🌳 Bush (b)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bush tiles have a chance to grow into a berry tile (🫐)</li>\n<li>When you move onto a bush tile you will lose 1 health (from the thorns)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🫐 Berry (c)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When you move onto a berry tile you will gain 1 food and it will be replaced by a grass tile (🟩)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🐇 Rabbit (d)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Rabbit tiles spawn randomly beside forest, bush, or plant tiles (as if the rabbit was hiding in it)</li>\n<li>Rabbit tiles will move similar to how you do</li>\n<li>If a rabbit tile moves onto a berry tile (🫐), it will eat it, removing the berry tile</li>\n<li>If a rabbit tile moves onto a tree, plant or bush tile, the rabbit tile will disappear (hide in the tile)</li>\n<li>When you move onto a rabbit tile you will gain 2 food and it will be replaced by a grass tile (🟩)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>😐 You (A)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Shows where you currently are located on the map</li>\n<li>Moves and needs to eat to survive </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>About The Actions</h2>\n<h3>⬆ Up</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Moves you up 1 tile</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>➡ Right</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Moves you right 1 tile</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>⬅ Left</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Moves you left 1 tile</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>⬇ Down</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Moves you down 1 tile</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>⏺ Stay</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Does nothing </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🎣 Fish</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Only usable beside water</li>\n<li>Gives you a chance to catch a fish and gain 1 food</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🗺 View Map</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Shows you the full map and your position (x,y) on the map (positions range from 0-29)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>💾 Save And Exit</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Saves your progress and exits the game</li>\n<li>Does not use an action</li>\n<li>Tiles might move/grow slightly differently then the way they were before a save</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exit</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Appears when you die</li>\n<li>Exits the shortcut </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Possible Future Updates</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add different possible outcomes of fishing </li>\n<li>Balance updates</li>\n<li>Adding new tiles with different effects </li>\n<li>Adding new effects to old tiles</li>\n<li>Bug fixes or reducing actions/code</li>\n<li>Adding different map skins</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2.1 - Oct. 28, 2021, 1:12 a.m.</strong></p><p>- iOS15.1 support</p>"}
