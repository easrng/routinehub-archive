Other than that it should not need anything else. It is imperative you have those apps installed above, i could not add Toolbox Pro or Charty to the dependencies. Will add them when i can find out what is going on.</p>\n<p>There are comments in the shortcut to explain what it is doing.</p>\n<h1>How it works:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>App starts off by checking is a Vehicle name exists in the database i.e. does A database even exist if not it will ask you to enter a vehicle name after wards that is the name it will use and it knows that this is no longer your first time logging data</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After it will run through and ask you to enter your current mileage, price / gal, and total price OR total gallons.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then it asks you if you are fulling filling it up (Yes or no) and if you missed one before. This is so that i knows if MPG should even be calculated as that is how Fuelly works so i just copied how it works. This is pretty obvious to me as you don't want to log MPG when you skipped one or you missed a log entry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then it will go ahead and log the data to the database after calculating MPG. If there are any errors such as negative mileage (i.e. you add a log that is when subtracted by your previous mileage comes out negative it will error out), you didn't supply all the necessary information, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then IF this is not your first log it will do such as calculating Avg and giving you a graph of only nonzero MPGs over time.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - April 21, 2020, 8:23 p.m.</strong></p>"}
