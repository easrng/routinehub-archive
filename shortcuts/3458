This shortcut allows you to quickly turn off features that drain battery.\nThis new version was built in a separate shortcut, and as such, required me to upload it separately. Thank you for the support! Features include: Fast Mode to instantly shut down battery draining features, Regular Mode to customize what you want shut down, Restore Mode to restore settings, BLPM Assistant to help with basic tasks, iOS always on display tutorials, QuickUpdater support, and more all in one quick, efficient, and clean package. Thanks! -Luckycat11 (u/Luckycat27 on Reddit) (Side Note: Requires the apps OLEDX and Google Assistant for bonus features that donâ€™t affect the main shortcut)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2647\"><img alt=\"This Shortcut Requires QuickUpdate - Tap To Download!\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7aYMAD3.png\"></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Sept. 4, 2019, 4:02 a.m.</strong></p><p>Name Change and Quick Update support added.</p>"}
