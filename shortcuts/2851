If the error message that the lyrics could not be found appears again and again when searching for lyrics, then it is probably not because the lyrics were not found or because the Google Request Rate was exceeded, but also because of another bug in iOS 13. (I personally cannot use the shortcut with iPadOS, for example. But I have no issues with two devices and iOS.) Hopefully, Apple will fix these bugs as soon as possible.</code></h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp; </p>\n<p><img alt=\"I Am Genius is 100% Malware Free\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3gZZqIZ.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h1><em>I Am Genius</em> helps you find the lyrics of your favourite songs!

You don't have to specify a folder. Tap on Save is enough. Your lyrics are automatically saved in <em>”iCloud Drive &gt; Shortcuts &gt; I Am Genius”</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Create Note:</strong> Save your lyrics as a note with <em>Apple Notes</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Print:</strong> Print your lyrics with <em>AirPrint®</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Share:</strong> Share the lyrics as text or PDF with friends via <em>AirDrop</em>, <em>Messages</em> or <em>WhatsApp</em>. Send them by <em>Mail</em> as text or PDF or transfer the lyrics to other apps like <em>Threema, Telegram, OneDrive, Dropbox</em> and so on…</li>\n<li><strong>Search:</strong> The result was not satisfactory at all?
