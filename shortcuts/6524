If you want to save the meme in your widget, simply click the widget and it will take you to the Reddit post! It is only compatible with the square widgets, small and large, but I suggest using the large one for better visibility of small text.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Feature list:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Clickable widget links to the corresponding Reddit post</li>\n<li>Easily customizable sizing of the images</li>\n<li>Adjustable subreddit list</li>\n<li>Built in updater (using RoutineHubâ€™s API)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/user/robbiegrawey\"> <img alt=\"Oops, the photo didn't load!\" src=\"https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/b237a1ee-df6e-404c-904c-bbce049ba0cf/createdbylabel.png/:/\"> </a></p><p></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Sept. 21, 2020, 3:18 p.m.</strong></p><p>Updated actions and improved updater</p>"}
