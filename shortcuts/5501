Although in a rock concert no-one will notice, in a classical concert it's your death sentence, not literally but you know what I mean.</p>\n<p>So this Shortcut if you choose \"Start\" will:\n- set volume to 0%\n- set brightness to 5%\n- turn Airplane Mode On\n- turn Do Not Disturb On until Turned Off</p>\n<p>if you choose \"End\" will:\n- set the Volume to 100%\n- set brightness to 76%\n- turn Airplane Mode Off\n- turn Do Not Disturb Off</p>\n<p>Enjoy your concert.</p>\n<p>As always if you have any suggestions please leave a feedback. Thank you!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.4 - June 15, 2020, 10:29 a.m.</strong></p><p>• Name change<br>• Bug fix</p>"}
