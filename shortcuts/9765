This is better suited to how I format posts in either a link list or full-on linked article post. It makes it easy to delete the lines you don't need when editing later.<br>- Now you can read and edit the blockquote when adding comments. Before you couldn't only read, not edit, and longer blockquotes could get cut off.<br>- If nothing is passed into the shortcut, it will ask for text where you can paste in a URL</p>"}
