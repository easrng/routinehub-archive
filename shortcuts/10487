If the iOS system number format is comma for decimals (European format) this shortcut gives an error if temp or speed have any decimal. In these systems both temp and wind speed must be whole numbers. If the IOS system has a period as decimal separator, decimals can be introduced]</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Nov. 12, 2021, 6:57 p.m.</strong></p><p>Update US formula</p>"}
