{"id":"3700","name":"Run Without Showing Actions","tagline":"a shortcut technique to ensure that shortcut actions are not displayed during shortcut execution","icon":"ios13 c4292093695 g59699","latest":"13150","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vbk4oKj.png\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Run Without Showing Actions</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>A <em>typical</em> shortcut will display all of the executing actions if it is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Run from the shortcuts editor using the right-pointing triangle.</li>\n<li>Run using the <strong>Share Sheet</strong>.</li>\n<li>Run from another shortcut using the <strong>Run Shortcut</strong> action with <strong>Show While Running</strong> enabled.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A <em>long</em> shortcut will run much more slowly if the executing actions are displayed. This is exasperated if the shortcut contains <strong>Repeat</strong> blocks.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of this shortcut is to provide template actions that will prevent a shortcut from displaying the actions as they are executed (regardless of the mechanism used to run it). This is done by including actions that cause the shortcut to rerun itself with <strong>Show While Running</strong> disabled. </p>\n<p>The actions in this template can be used for <em>Share Sheet</em> or <em>non Share Sheet</em> shortcuts. The original <strong>Shortcut Input</strong> will be preserved for subsequent use in the shortcut.</p>\n<p>The shortcut includes several embedded comments to clarify the purpose of the template actions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Tests</h3>\n<p>This shortcut was tested using <strong>iOS 13.3 (17C54)</strong> on an <strong>iPhone 8 Plus</strong> and <strong>iPadOS 13.3 beta 3</strong> on a <strong>10.5‚Äù iPad Pro</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Run Without Showing Actions</strong> is available exclusively on <a href=\"https://routinehub.co\">RoutineHub.co</a>.
