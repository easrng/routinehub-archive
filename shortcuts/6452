This shortcut can help you. </p>\n<p>This shortcut can extract shooting time and location from the photo’s EXIF metadata (allow the user to review and edit), and allow the user to enter a short message to describe the moment. All info will be encoded to a QR code and watermark to a corner of the photo and can be read by any QR code scanner in the future. So even the photo be printed, the moment will live forever.</p>\n<p>Examples:<br>\nhttps://flic.kr/p/2jF62yB<br>\nhttps://flic.kr/p/2jF1Sgc</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nOnce the shortcut completed the editing, i.e. added the QR code to the photo and displays the edited photo in the preview window, the photo <strong>does not</strong> be saved automatically. You need to save it through the “Share With” in the preview window. You can simply print it / share it with others and then discard the change.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.1 - Sept. 10, 2020, 1:44 a.m.</strong></p><p>Increase the watermark opacity from 40 to 50 to be better recognized by scanner.</p>"}
