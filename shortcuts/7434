His shortcut (Wifi Sandwich) is no longer compatible with ios, so I decided to develop an alternative! However, if it breaks you can reach out to me and I will do my best to fix it. Quality of life comments are appreciated. Feel free to use code from this shortcut, but give me credit!</p>\n<p>Wifis lets you save, create, and view QR codes for wireless networks.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.3.4 - Dec. 4, 2020, 4:38 a.m.</strong></p><p>Readable V Card menu</p>"}
