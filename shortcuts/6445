Shortcuts Widget now supports all widget sizes, and the images are now just as sharp as those on the official Shortcuts widget. I’ve rebuilt everything nearly from scratch — including switching from Text boxes to Dictionary actions so its easier to fill in your info. You do still need to Bas64 encode your images and paste them in, so it will take a couple minutes of work to set up the widgets. <br>The widgets produced by this shortcut are now called “Shortcuts (Small)”, “Shortcuts (Medium)” and “Shortcuts (Large)”, so your previous widget won’t be overwritten. <br><br>Every part of this shortcut is labeled as clearly as possible to make it easy to adjust it for your own purposes, and the directions for setup are listed at the top of the shortcut itself.</p>"}
