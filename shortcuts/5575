It gets the page title and opens a page to post to diigo. I created this before diigo had a Share action but it is still often better in my opinion that the native diigo Share action. </p>\n<h1>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h1>\n<p>This shortcut has an integrated update mechanism called  <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\">Embed-a-Update</a>. Thanks to the embedded updater, it does not require any external updater shortcut. The shortcut checks for updates itself, so you'll never miss an update and it is super fast. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cpBjhE3_d.webp?maxwidth=1000&amp;fidelity=large\"></a>\n</p><p></p><p></p>\n<p>If this Shortcut doesnâ€™t work as expected, you have suggestions, or an idea to improve it, let me know!</p>\n<p>See also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4234\">Clean Apple News Links</a> Finds the original source link from Apple News.</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - June 16, 2020, 6:27 a.m.</strong></p>"}
