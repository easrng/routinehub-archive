It has the ability to do many powerful tasks such as launching other shortcuts and having its own control center. You can set a password to stop prying eyes to see what you are doing, it even encrypts your password. Did you forget your password? You can recover it with your Recovery Code, via the help of Aero from the Launchpad recovery center. You can change the assistant's name and features are added all the time.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><br>\n<br></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2692\"><img alt=\"This shortcut supports Swing Updater!\" src=\"https://d3w10.netlify.com/RHImages/Swing%20Updater%20Badge.png\"></a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VBSZY2Y.png\"><br>\nThis Shortcut is available exclusively on RoutineHub.co.
