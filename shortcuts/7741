Do you wish you could have those songs sent to a playlist automatically, so that you can listen to all of them later? If so, iMessage2Spotify is for you.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: This Shortcut requires a one-time initial setup.</strong> Complete setup by tapping on iMessage2Spotify in your Shortcuts app after you download it.</p>\n<p>Issues? Post here: https://github.com/iannotian/imessage2spotify-serverless/issues</p>\n<p><em>Minor issue with how automated the automation is</em></p>\n<p>Apple does not allow Personal Automations triggered by Messages to trigger without tapping it first. This means for every song link that you receive, you will have to tap on the Shortcut notification and press Run to add it to your playlist. Note that these triggers will stay in your Notification Center, so you can run all of them at once, if you'd like. You don't need to run them immediately after receiving a message.</p>\n<p><em>Troubleshooting</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Try deleting the imessage2spotify.json file in your iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/ folder to reset everything, and then run iMessage2Spotify again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Try logging out and back into Spotify web via Safari if you have issues authorizing during setup.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Revoking playlist access</em></p>\n<p>If you wish to revoke iMessage2Spotify's playlist read/write access, go to https://www.spotify.com/us/account/apps/ and press <code>Remove Access</code>.</p>\n<p><em>Source Code</em></p>\n<p>Source can be found at github.com/iannotian/imessage2spotify-serverless</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - April 2, 2022, 8:59 p.m.</strong></p><p>i2S is now hosted on Vercel and leverages Next.js Functions for improved server cold-start performance.
