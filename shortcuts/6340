You can either use the Share menu on the file directly or, run the shortcut and choose the file. </p>\n<p>This is a companion to <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6341\">Backup a Shortcut</a>. </p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1048\">Backup to Mac</a> which backs up all your shortcuts to a device running macOS.</p>\n<p>If this Shortcut doesnâ€™t work as expected, you have suggestions, or an idea to improve it, let me know!</p>\n<h1>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h1>\n<p>This shortcut has an integrated update mechanism called  <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\">Embed-a-Update</a>. Thanks to the embedded updater, it does not require any external updater shortcut. The shortcut checks for updates itself, so you'll never miss an update and it is super fast. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cpBjhE3_d.webp?maxwidth=1000&amp;fidelity=large\"></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.1 - Aug. 26, 2020, 9:15 p.m.</strong></p><p>icon change and tyYou there?</p>"}
