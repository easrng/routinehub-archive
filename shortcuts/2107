The SSID's and the Passwords. After that you can just run the shortcut press on the network you want to share and a scan able QR code will be generated.</p>\n<p>After the person who wants to join your wifi scans that code they will be prompted with \"Join network .......... \" and they can press on it and the Iphone will connect automatically.
