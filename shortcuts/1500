Well, it is now a Siri shortcut! Once you run the shortcut, select the recipients of who you want to send it to. It might freeze a little bit when you run it due to the fact that it has so many characters.  You might have more fun on iOS 11 because it might work more. Also, the original website that had the bug is currently down. That's why I made it! So try it out for yourself!  Note: this shortcut won't receive any more changes because it's just a little short cut with a bug that you can prank anybody with. This is not harmful in anyway, so don't be alarmed.  This shortcut works with the apps contacts and messages.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Jan. 9, 2019, 12:48 a.m.</strong></p>"}
