To automatically update X-PassSafe, we use Infinite Updater. Use it to download and install any updates available on your shortcut.</p>\n<h3>Is there any implementing needed?</h3><p><strong>No</strong>. This is because everything is already setup and all that’s left is you adding the passwords.</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3><p>To make X-PassSafe work for you, you need an iCloud Drive and have it enabled as active. Other than that, X-PassSafe works at an incredibly fast speed. This is the only and last password saver you’d need.</p><p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3098\"><img alt=\"This Shortcut Supports Infinite Updater\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/6wNc6vj/06896986-3-C5-D-4-EB1-BD5-A-7078-B266-B664.png\"></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - July 10, 2019, 8:33 a.m.</strong></p>"}
