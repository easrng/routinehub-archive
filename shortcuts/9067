The integration of Apple's cycle tracking makes <strong>ebb for Health</strong> the ideal compliment to tracking and storing your menstrual data.</p>\n<h1>How to Use <strong>ebb for Health</strong></h1>\n<h2>Log Flow + Symptoms</h2>\n<p><strong>ebb for Health</strong> will ask you to record symptoms along with your menstrual flow or fluid (cervical mucus quality). </p>\n<p>When finished, <strong>ebb for Health</strong> will do its thing, and vibrate to alert that it's done. Best of all: the data is logged in the Health app and in a personal folder without a premium cloud service; with <strong>ebb for Health</strong>, the backup file lives at <em>/Shortcuts/ebb/ebb4health.txt</em>. Import the file into a spreadsheet program, transpose the columns and rows, and experiment with the possibilities! </p>\n<p><strong><em>Disclaimer</em></strong>: <strong>ebb for Health</strong> tracks location to access the daily weather forecast. Weather conditions can affect symptoms, i.e. headaches. This information is <strong>ONLY</strong> saved to the ebb4health file. To exclude weather conditions, turn metadata to \"false\" (how-to visual in the Shortcut). This will not affect recorded data and can be reversed at any time.</p>\n<h1><strong>And that's it!</strong></h1>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<p>This shortcut has been designed using resources from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com\">flaticon</a></li>\n<li>Jackson Dame's<a href=\"https://www.jacksondame.com\"> Harnessing Tech challenge</a></li>\n<li>the subreddit on Shortcuts, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/\">r/shortcuts</a></li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.3 - May 23, 2022, 1:51 p.m.</strong></p><p>fixed issue with certain categories not logging to Health; and<br>various bug fixes + editing to improve consistency + flow.</p>"}
