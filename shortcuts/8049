THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP.</p>\n<h2>Features:</h2>\n\n<p>All your daily notes will be automatically put in that folder with the current date already assigned.</p>\n<p>Another feature is that you can add more notes into your Daily Journal so you won't have to keep going back to your Notes app to edit. This will automatically be put in the latest Journal Entry you've made.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you can easily preview your Journal Entries with this shortcut simply by clicking \"View Journal Entries\". This will allow you to see all the Journal Entries you have made without going to your notes app. It will be sorted from your Latest Entries.</p>\n<p>This is a very simple shortcut I originally made for my Mom who doesn't want all the complications from downloading apps or going through so many other things to keep track of what she's done for the day. </p>\n<p>It's really as simple as it can get, hope you guys like it!</p>\n<p>Please leave a feedback if youâ€™ve encountered any type of error or want me to add something.</p>\n<h2>Screenshot</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Trulli\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Jvppf2N.jpg\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.4 - Jan. 19, 2021, 3:41 a.m.</strong></p><p>- Added a notification banner once action is successfully done.</p>"}
