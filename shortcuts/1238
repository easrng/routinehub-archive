So when you run it for the first time in the Shortcuts app, please allow access to <em>RoutineHub.co</em>. You only have to do that once.</li>\n<li>To run this shortcut, you need a TV that supports HDMI-CEC, an Apple TV and you have to be on the same Wi-Fi network as your Apple TV. Furthermore you need to grant access to <em>Apple TV Remote</em>. In the second step of those five <em>Import Questions</em> please select your Apple TV.</li>\n<li>Do you want the Apple Remote Control app to open after your Apple TV and TV are turned on/woken up? Type \"Yes\" or \"No\".</li>\n<li>No matter which answer you chose in the previous step. Please select your Apple TV again. If you chose e.g. \"No\" in step 3, but want to change this setting to \"Yes\" later, that's no problem. All you have to do is return to the <em>Import Questions</em>: Open the shortcut in edit mode and tap the button with the three dots in the upper right corner. Then tap on \"Customize Shortcut\".</li>\n<li>One last thing: With iOS 13 it is no longer possible to create your own Siri phrases like in iOS 12. Now with iOS 13 the name of the shortcut is also the Siri phrase. Since the name of the shortcut is \"Turn on my TV\", you have to activate the shortcut as follows: \"Hey Siri, turn on my TV\". If you want to use another Siri phrase, you have to rename the shortcut.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Turn on my TV Part 1/3\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kcmQfln.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"Turn on my TV Part 2/3\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yJEYHZH.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"Turn on my TV Part 3/3\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/C3Lq0BU.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h2>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h2>\n<p><em>Turn on my TV</em> has an integrated update mechanism called <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/793\">Embed-a-Update</a>.

The shortcut checks for updates itself, so you'll always be up to date and never miss an update.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\" title=\"Get Embed-a-Update\"><img alt=\"This Shortcut supports Embed-a-Update\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cpBjhE3.png\"></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h4><em>All graphics on this page were made with MediaKit</em></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911\"><img alt=\"Graphics created with MediaKit\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Unqyoq.png\"></a> </p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Exclusively available on RoutineHub.co\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VBSZY2Y.png\"></p>\n<p><em>This Shortcut is available exclusively on RoutineHub.co.
