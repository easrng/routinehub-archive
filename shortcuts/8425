Depending on the battery percentage and/or whether the device is being charged or disconnected from a charger, it performs a certain amount of actions. If the battery percentage is below (number you set), it sets a reminder to charge your device for the next day. If it is above that (number you set), it deletes that reminder if it exists. Once your device begins charging, it removes that reminder, yet if it is disconnected from its charger, it runs the shortcut again to make sure the reminder is either set correctly or deleted.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.0 - Aug. 6, 2021, 4:32 p.m.</strong></p><p>Adds and deletes reminders based on devices.</p>"}
