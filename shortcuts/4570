It's fairly simple it takes a photo(s) you pick and adds the average color of the picture as a canvas to the long side of a photo. For tall photos it will add it to the side, for short it adds it above. Useful for posting photos online via Instagram and other sources.</p>\n<p>I have not added in the code to post it anywhere this will simply give you a preview screen/share sheet (at this time).</p>\n<p>You will have to have Toolbox Pro to use this shortcut. At this time it won't come up as a selectable option under the required apps area so I am putting it here and will change it later once I can.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Feb. 12, 2020, 10:53 p.m.</strong></p>"}
