If you add a photo you're going to end up with the following note:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Diary 2019/01/27</h1>\n<p>Your text</p>\n<p>Your new text</p>\n<p><img alt=\"sample photo\" src=\"https://bear.app/static/images/video_placeholder.jpg\" title=\"A photo\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>#Diary/Image</p>\n<p>#Diary/2019/01/27</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The note above contains a new type of tag. This helps you finding notes with similar types of files.\nYou can end up with the following tag structure.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Diary</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2019</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>01</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>27</p>\n<p>28</p>\n<p>29</p>\n<p>30</p>\n<p>31</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>02</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>01</p>\n<p>02</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Image</p>\n<p>Media</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’ve only tested with images and audio files, but feel free to experiment with other types and let me know in the comments which other tags it creates.</p>\n<h3>Reference file</h3>\n<p>A reference file is used to keep track of the latest note you created. This is created in your Shortcuts folder on your iCloud account. This contains a small JSON like the one next. This JSON will only contain one entry so it won’t take more space than initially.</p>\n<pre><code>{“latestEntry\":\n    {\"date\":\"2019\\/01\\/27\",\n     \"identifier\":\"63DEC2B7-5926-48E2-B854-A29FF5B7DDF3-737-000000673BF3135F”}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.00 - Jan. 27, 2019, 1:37 p.m.</strong></p>"}
