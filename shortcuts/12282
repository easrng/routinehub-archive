Any image format supported by iOS will be ok, because the shortcut will convert it to jpg internally.</li>\n<li>The shortcut will open the a-Shell Mini app and will run the ffmpeg program to process the file and to add the cover image without changing the original audio stream.</li>\n<li>Wait for the process to finish without touching the screen.</li>\n<li>When finished you will be asked where do you want to save the resulting audio file. The output file name will be the same of the source audio file plus the \"_cover\" postfix.</li>\n<li>DONE! :D\nNote that iOS does not show the covers for most of the file formats. You can check the cover opening the file in your favourite audio player.
