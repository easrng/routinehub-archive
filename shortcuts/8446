The areas you load are saved, and more areas are loaded as you move.</p>\n<p>In this alpha version, you can move around the world and explore areas such as villages, fields, forests, and mountains. You can also do things like build a shelter and cut down trees.</p>\n<p>While is all you can currently do, but I am planning on adding many features such as an energy system, resources, health, entities like monsters and animals, a combat system, and other features. This shortcut is still in a very early alpha state, so donâ€™t expect too much from it!</p>\n<p>(This shortcut might be a little slow when you first run it because it has to get the images it needs to run. Make sure to allow it to access the images from the URLs it tries to open. It uses files to create saves, so make sure you allow it to access your iCloud Drive.)</p>\n<p>Have fun exploring!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.0.2 - Feb. 19, 2021, 7:32 p.m.</strong></p><p>Made the image for mountains work.</p>"}
