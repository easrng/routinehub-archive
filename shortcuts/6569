Any other types are classified as <em>Other</em> üÖû.</li>\n<li>Clipboard <em>Type</em> and <em>Length</em> (for <em>Text</em> and <em>Rich text</em>) are indicated.</li>\n<li>The <em>Clipboard</em> can be previewed and shared.</li>\n<li><em>Rich text</em> can be converted to <em>plain text</em>.</li>\n<li><em>Dictionaries</em> (i.e., JSON file content) can be converted to <em>pretty text</em>.</li>\n<li><em>Shortcut Input</em> can be optionally used to update the <em>Clipboard</em>. For example, <em>photos</em>, <em>screenshots</em>, and <em>videos</em> can be shared from the <strong>Photo</strong> app; <em>files</em> (of many types) can be shared from the <strong>Files</strong> app; and <em>URLs</em>, <em>Page Titles</em>, and <em>Page Content</em> can be shared from <strong>iOS browsers</strong>. The following browsers have been tested: <em>Safari</em>, <em>DuckDuckGo</em>, <em>Chrome</em>, <em>Browser and Documents Manager</em>, <em>Opera Touch</em>, <em>Private Browser Deluxe</em>, <em>1Password</em>, <em>Onion</em>, <em>Reedle Documents</em> (only passes URL, i.e., no <em>Page Title</em> under some circumstances), <em>Firefox</em>, <em>Firefox Focus</em>, <em>Brave</em>, <em>Edge</em>, <em>Dolphin (iOS 14 crashes)</em>, <em>Ghostery</em>, <em>Yandex</em>.</li>\n<li><em>Clipboard</em>/<em>Shortcut Input</em> values can be saved and later restored. Values are saved to iCloud, thus they can be shared with any device that shares the same iCloud account. </li>\n<li><em>Shortcut Input</em> and <em>Clipboard</em> values can be previewed/saved independently, or the <em>Clipboard</em> can be automatically updated (depending on the <strong>Automatically Copy Shortcut Input to Clipboard</strong> configuration parameter).</li>\n<li>Restored values can replace, prepend, append the current <em>Clipboard</em>. If the entries are <em>Text</em>, the text is prepended or appended; other types become multiple entries in the iOS <em>Clipboard</em> (i.e., like an array, but not limited to the same <em>Type</em>). For example, the <em>Clipboard</em> could be modified to include the following: <em>Image</em>, <em>PDF</em>, and a <em>text string</em>.</li>\n<li>Saved values are shared between iOS devices, thus a Clipboard <em>saved</em> on one device can be <em>restored</em> on another.</li>\n<li>Titles can be optionally added to the saved entries. Titles are automatically suggested for some circumstances. For example, if the <em>Clipboard</em> includes 25 lines of text, <strong>Clipboard Tool</strong> will suggest the following title: 25üÑª.</li>\n<li><em>Text</em> clipboards can be modified; <em>Image</em> clipboards can be marked up.</li>\n<li>The <em>Clipboard</em> can be cleared with or without confirmation (depending on the <strong>Confirm Clipboard Clear</strong> configuration parameter).</li>\n<li>Saved clipboards can be multiple items (e.g., three images), including entries of different types (e.g., <em>Image</em>, <em>Text</em>).</li>\n<li><strong>Clipboard Tool</strong> is compatible with iOS 13 and iOS 14.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>Shortcut Testing</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6569/\">Clipboard Tool</a>, Version 2.1, has been tested with the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>iOS 13.7, 14.0.1 and 14.2 Developer Beta 3</li>\n<li>iPhone 8 Plus</li>\n<li>iPad Pro 10.5\"</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>Shortcut Development and Acknowledgments</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Clipboard Tool</strong> is available exclusively at <a href=\"https://routinehub.co\">RoutineHub.co</a>. Versions obtained elsewhere might be out-of-date.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This shortcut includes a complex Dictionary action that includes 33 context sensitive variations of the main menu. Configuring a large Dictionary like this manually would be very tedious and error-prone, thus it was built using a very creative and useful shortcut named <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4626\">Dictionary Action Builder</a>, by <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/user/gluebyte\">@gluebyte</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There were a few additional JSON tools that were used during the development of this shortcut: a) The <strong>Prettify</strong> action included in the iOS app, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jayson/id1447750768\">Jayson</a>, by Simon B. St√∏vring; b) The <strong>Pretty Print Dictionaries</strong> action included in the iOS app, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toolbox-pro-for-shortcuts/id1476205977\">Toolbox Pro for Shortcuts</a>, by Alex Hay; c) [JSON FORMATTER &amp; VALIDATOR] (https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com), by CURIOUS CONCEPT; and d) <a href=\"https://jsonlint.com\">JSONLint - The JSON VALIDATOR</a>, by CircleCell.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As mentioned above, <strong>Clipboard Tool</strong> can accept values by launching it via the <em>Share Sheet</em>. Many different file types have been <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Hw4BcO1.png\">tested from a variety of iOS apps</a>. During testing using the <strong>Files</strong> app, two iOS bugs (?) were discovered: 1) If a JSON file is long-tapped  and <strong>Share</strong> is selected, <strong>Clipboard Tool</strong> is selected from the <em>Share Sheet</em>, nothing is passed to the shortcut. This appears to be a universal bug with JSON files, not necessary limited to the <strong>Files</strong> app. 2) If the JSON file is <em>copied</em> (rather than <em>shared</em>) and any shortcut like <strong>Clipboard Tool</strong> is started, the iOS <em>Clipboard</em> is <em>sometimes</em> not populated with the contents of the JSON file. This can normally be addressed by repeating the copy process from the <strong>Files</strong> app.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As mentioned above, <strong>Clipboard Tool</strong> can convert <em>Dictionaries</em> (i.e., JSON file content) to pretty text. I found the necessary actions in a shortcut created by reddit user <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gluebyte/\">u/gluebyte</a>. For more information, please refer to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/gqq43h/dictionaryjson_pretty_print/\">Dictionary/JSON Pretty Print</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>One weakness of iOS 14 shortcuts is that lists can be scroll sluggishly as the number of entries grow large. To circumvent this shortcoming, when the saved items exceeds a defined threshold, this shortcut combines actions that provide a means to list a subset of saved items. In addition when it exceeds another defined threshold, it includes pagination logic that was derived from <strong>PaginateList</strong> in <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2145\">.libUILibrary</a> by <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/user/entee\">@entee</a>. Although likely unnecessary, these <em>list thresholds</em> can be adjusted using the <strong>Choose from List (iOS 14)</strong> dictionary embedded in the shortcut main dictionary.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The framed screenshots were created using the shortcut <strong>Apple Frames (iOS)</strong> from the <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/shortcuts/\">MacStories Shortcuts Archive</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Clipboard Tool</strong> checks for updates of itself every 7 days using <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\">Embed-a-Update</a> (Version: 1.1.2, Updated: 10/13/19). On demand update checking can be performed by running <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2692/\">Swing Updater</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.1 - Oct. 19, 2020, 2:40 a.m.</strong></p><p>- Optimized to reduce shortcut execution time.<br>- Improved embedded comments.</p>"}
