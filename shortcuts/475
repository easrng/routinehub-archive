You can say things like, \"<strong>Launch Plex</strong>,\" \"<strong>Netflix and Chill</strong>,\" or \"<strong>Pause Roku</strong>.\" You can perform a search in Roku with whatever keywords you like by saying something like \"<strong>Search for</strong>\" followed by the keywords. This Shortcut can also add and remove Roku devices to control, as well as Channels to launch. It uses a JSON database stored in an iCloud folder to maintain your devices and channels. The actions themselves use Roku's Web API to send commands to your device (using its IP).</p>\n<h2>To Install:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/475\">Download Roku Voice</a> and run it.</li>\n<li>On initial run, it will install the setup shortcut, which will guide you through the rest of the setup, including adding your first device, channel, and installing specific actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>To use:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Launch Roku Voice and say a command.</li>\n<li>To change Roku device</li>\n<li>You can say things like: \"<strong>Switch to Living Room</strong>,\" or \"<strong>Change Servers</strong>,\" or \"<strong>Swap device to Bedroom</strong>\"</li>\n<li>To change Roku channels</li>\n<li>Say something like: \"<strong>Launch Plex</strong>,\" or \"<strong>Change channel to Netflix</strong>.\" Using the name of the channel directly will work as well.</li>\n<li>To turn the Roku off/on</li>\n<li>Try saying: \"<strong>TV on</strong>,\" or \"<strong>Roku off.</strong>\"</li>\n<li>To play or pause Roku</li>\n<li>Simply say: \"<strong>Play</strong>\" or \"<strong>Pause</strong>\"</li>\n<li>To Search Roku</li>\n<li>Say: \"<strong>Search</strong>\" followed by the keywords.</li>\n<li>\"<strong>Look for</strong>\" or \"<strong>Find</strong>\" will also work.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tips</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Set a Siri Shortcut to trigger Roku Voice with a phrase like \"<strong>Hey Roku.</strong>\"</li>\n<li>The voice detection works by identifying key words that correspond to specific actions, then those actions parse out the remaining commands and \"does stuff\" to your Roku.
