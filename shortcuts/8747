I do.</strong></p>\n<p>This shortcut checks your contacts for birthdays \"today\". </p>\n<p>Whilst you can run it any time that you want to, it is best set up to use with a personal automation. For example, set a personal automation that runs this shortcut at sunrise each day. When you pick up your device and check notifications the list of contacts with birthdays will be waiting for you.</p>\n<p>For more birthday options see my related shortcut \"Birthdays Anytime\".</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.01 - May 15, 2021, 5:49 a.m.</strong></p><p>Worked around an apparent shortcut date calculation bug that resulted in some ages being incorrectly calculated.</p>"}
