Basically it gets the sunrise time from weather, sunset time from weather and current time from current date. The next step is determines wether the current time is after sunrise and before sunset (Day time)? Or is it after sunset and before sunrise (Night time)?</p>\n<p>This could have many applications. For example:</p>\n<p>I use it to run Netflix app on Apple TV. If it’s night time the app with launch and the living room lights (in Homekit) will set up the mode for watching a movie. If it’s day time the Netflix app will launch on Apple TV, but there will be no light automation. The main steps are:\n1. Run the shortcut. \n2. Check of it is day or night. \n3. In Day Time: Netflix runs. \n4. In Night Time: Netflix runs, Homekit scene On. </p>\n<p>I hope you find this useful.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Oct. 8, 2019, 2:25 p.m.</strong></p><p>Simpler way of calculation</p>"}
