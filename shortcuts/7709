As an example this will help you with your (web)shop or like how I use it on the movie set, scan items I get out of my setbag and into it, I labeled everything and can track exactly how much I’m missing or if I still got it in my setbag.</p>\n<p>This inventory manager is able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have multiple inventories stored in your iCloud and add new or remove inventories.</li>\n<li>Scan as much items as you want and add them to an inventory.</li>\n<li>Display the items in a specific inventory including the amount of all the items in an easy to check list. When there is a 0 or negative number, it will even display the item in red to easily see that it’s out of items.</li>\n<li>You can easily scan to add or subtract a single item in that inventory.</li>\n<li>You can add or subtract multiple items from the menu.</li>\n<li>You can easily scan and rename single items in the inventory.</li>\n<li>You can easily scan and remove the item from the inventory completely.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we go along and people will like it, I will add more functions to the Inventory Manager. I am happy to receive feedback whenever you have something.</p>\n<p>It will take a while for you to set it all up, but when it’s up and running, you will be scanning and checking every item you have!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.0 - Dec. 7, 2020, 9:07 p.m.</strong></p>"}
