This shortcut is not affiliated with Phit-n-Phat Personal Training LLC and is a personal project of one of the programs members. </p>\n<p>This shortcut relies on the Reminders app and Notes app to host all of your hunger scale notes. I decided to use the Reminders app in order to allow myself to check off when meals have been added to my planner and the Notes app to have a compiled list easy for later review.</p>\n<p>IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU CREATE A REMINDER LIST &amp; NOTES FOLDER JUST FOR YOUR NOTIFICATIONS. You will be asked to input the name of your Reminder List when you first run this shortcut.</p>\n<p>Recent updates include: Water Tracker, Movement Tracker, and a place to track your Thoughts!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.21 - May 22, 2020, 7:37 p.m.</strong></p><p>Thoughts weren’t saving to Notes - fixed that!<br><br>I swear it feels like something breaks each time I update. This will be the last update for a while as I’m done adding features for now. Thanks for your patience!</p>"}
