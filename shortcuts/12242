Then:  </p>\n<p>● PHASE 1 (RECON Mode):<br>\n - Create a new empty Reminder List named \"Shazam Playlist\" (this script uses Reminders as playlist holder to stay independent from Apple Music or iTunes).<br>\n - Start the shortcut while you are playing a music playlist or a radio channel.<br>\n - Follow the instructions and the script will start recognizing the song with Shazam.<br>\n - The shortcut will save the song informations, the cover image and the youtube URL in the reminder list named \"Shazam Playlist\".<br>\n - The shortcut will ask if you want to recognize another song. If yes, you will need to use the CONTROL CENTER to unpause or play the next song (to avoid interrupting the shortcut), and then press the OK button in the shortcut to start the recognition.<br>\n - If you choose to stop recognizing songs, then the Shortcut will ask if you want to download the songs you identified.   </p>\n<p>● PHASE 1 Alternative (FETCH Mode):<br>\n - Choose a song in Shazam<br>\n - Click the Share button<br>\n - Select this shortcut from the actions list<br>\n - IMPORTANT: If the shortcut is stuck, just exit the Shazam app (swiping bottom up). If after choosing from the menu option it is stuck again, swipe bottom-up once more. Apparently this will be fixed in iOS 16.<br>\n - The shortcut will find the corresponding YouTube link from <strong>Odesli</strong> (https://odesli.co) if it exists.  </p>\n<p>● PHASE 2 (in common):<br>\n - The shortcut will open the a-Shell Mini app and will start downloading the songs from Youtube with Youtube-dl.<br>\n - Wait for the process to finish (it will be slow because the script waits up to 30 seconds between the downloads to avoid your IP being banned from Youtube. Be patient). The audio files downloaded would be in the best quality, bitrate and format available on Youtube. They would not be reencoded, to avoid any quality loss.<br>\n - When it completed the downloads, you will be asked to select a folder to save them. Optionally you can choose to zip them in a single archive file.<br>\n - DONE! :D  </p>\n<p>Enjoy the songs in your favourite audio player. My favourite on iOS is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flacbox-flac-player-music/id1097564256\">Flacbox</a>.  </p>\n<h1>REQUIREMENTS</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>You need the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/ao/app/a-shell-mini/id1543537943\">a-Shell Mini</a> app installed.  </li>\n<li>You need to install my other shortcut: <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12313/\"><strong>Shazam Link Converter</strong></a>. The version must be 1.0.2 or greater.  </li>\n<li>Apple Reminders app and Shazam should also be installed on your device.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h1>\n<p>This shortcut was inspired by <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10630/\">Shazam Save</a>  (author: @mvan231) and <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6400/\">Music Downloader</a> (author: @creepyeyesOO).
