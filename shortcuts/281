It uses UpdateKit in case I want to add any more search engines.</p>\n<p>The first time you install this shortcut, you will go through a simple setup process to choose which search engine you would like to use. It then stores your choice inside iCloud Drive. I chose this method as an alternative to import questions so you wouldn't have to go through them each time you install or update the shortcut.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - Nov. 10, 2018, 9:12 p.m.</strong></p><p>-Added create folder action</p>"}
