PDF files are considered to be the most commonly used format for sending documents. However, some systems or emails may have requirements regarding the size of uploaded files. For example, I can think of government agencies that can only receive attachments around 2 megabytes in size. As a result, many users want to reduce the size of the PDF. This not only reduces the file but also frees up memory.</p>\n<p>Instruction:</p>\n<p>1.) Select one of three quality levels. My tip: Medium quality!</p>\n<p>2.) Please choose a file from your iCloud Drive to create a reduced PDF! (This is done by image reduction)</p>\n<p>3.) Info: This process may take some time depending on the size of the source file! </p>\n<p>4.) Your PDF file in low quality is now created! </p>\n<p>5.) Please select an app from the iOS \"Share Menu\" to save or send!</p>\n<p>THE DESCRIPTIONS IN THE SHORTCUT ARE IN GERMAN!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.01 - April 3, 2021, 3:34 p.m.</strong></p><p>Minor bug fixes.</p>"}
