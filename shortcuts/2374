Best to stick to either #tagginglowercase or #TaggingPascalCase, but not mixing both methods.\n- Reminders, incomplete are searched.\n- Calendars looks at future events in the next 3 years\n- Notes, part matching happens eg #test will return #testing\n- Selecting multiple tags test if any are present, not all.\n- Notes searches only returns 26 results currently, as the Shortcut looks to see if a # is present first of all, this could cause less than 26 results to be found.\n- Incorrect tags might be found if you have html in your notes/reminders etc</p>\n<h3>Calling from other Shortcuts</h3>\n<p>I made this so I could call as a function from other Shortcuts I use as well. </p>\n<h4>FindTags</h4>\n<p>FindTags is the part that looks for the presence of tags, and selects them, it only needs the function name passed as a dictionary.</p>\n<pre><code>function : FindTags \n</code></pre>\n\n<h4>SearchForTags</h4>\n<p>SearchForTags will search for a tag and show the results found, it needs a tag/tags passed to it as a list as well as the function name.</p>\n<pre><code>function: SearchForTags\ntag: &lt;list of tags&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.01 - April 8, 2019, 8:17 p.m.</strong></p><p>Add priority to reminder view</p>"}
