The <em><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1405459188\">Scriptable</a></em> app is required. It works in two simple steps:</p>\n<p>➀ Run it, select a subreddit from the menu, and it will open a webpage with two parts:<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/7254fe006726c022d54c8a1e9b8419ae/cf6b4aca1de39330-ed/s1280x1920/b7c50859dd7e41dcd1f13aab922699f128f7ed10.jpg\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>First part contains updated posts with new comments. Not all updated posts, but only those that you marked interest.</li>\n<li>Second part contains new posts since the last check.</li>\n<li>Tap a post and it will open in the Reddit client of your choice. (To switch between Reddit and browser, long press a post and select “Open in Reddit app” or “Open in Background”. Do it once, and it will remember your choice. For Chrome, you need to do this in Safari first.)</li>\n<li>Come back to your browser until you have read enough.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>➁ To track new posts that interest you, you need to run the shortcut again:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there are any new posts, the webpage shows you the <em>Run Reddit Tracker</em> link at the bottom for your convenience.</li>\n<li>Run it and select posts. These posts will be tracked in subsequent runs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's it. Run it again whenever you want to check for updates. It will end silently if there is no update. A couple of notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When adding a subreddit, you are asked to enter the number of recent posts you would like to track. For example, if a subreddit has about 20 new posts everyday and you want to track posts for at least 3 days, you can enter 60 or higher. Tracked posts that fall outside the number will be removed from the track list.</li>\n<li>If you want to add a post to track manually from the Reddit client, tap the share button of the post and run Reddit Tracker.</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1.3 - Feb. 26, 2022, 11:47 a.m.</strong></p><p>2022-02-26<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Usability improvements</p>"}
