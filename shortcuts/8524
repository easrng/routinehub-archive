If the album is found on Spotify it proceeds or if not found shows 'album not found' and the shortcut stops. Shortcuts calls the API for the 1st Lambda function which returns the Spotify Album ID and the song list to shortcuts. Shortcuts then shows the song list and asks the user to input the songs to download. Shortcuts take this input and album ID to call the API for 2nd lambda function. The second lambda function assigns a process-id, calls a 3rd lambda function (no api call needed for 3rd func because it is called by the 2nd function) and returns a p-id to shortcuts. Then shortcuts waits for the 3rd lambda function to complete downloading and the songs depending on the number of songs requested. Shortcuts then calls the 3rd function with p-id to get the links of the S3 urls of the songs. The function returns the links to shortcuts. Shortcuts uses those links to download the songs using the urls and saves it to your iPhone.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Feb. 25, 2021, 1:36 p.m.</strong></p>"}
