And from time to time, you might need to share a quick summary of it with someone - such as a treating health professional, physician/doctor, nutritionist, or the like.</p>\n<p>But at present, there's no easy way to get the data out into a short, easy to read and sharable summary.</p>\n<p>That's what this shortcut (under development) is for.</p>\n<h2>What it currently does</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Render a report - in a nice HTML like format - showing average activity data for the last 30 days, and the data for the most recent day (Step count only as of this first release).<br><br>The resulting report can then be shared or saved however you choose, using the system share sheet - saved as a file, converted to PDF, emailed, or printed, etc.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Uses <a href=\"https://www.mikebeas.com/updatekit/\">UpdateKit</a> and <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/69\">RoutinePub</a> to ensure you have the latest version of this Shortcut after each execution.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"An example of the report produced by this shortcut, from the 0.01 release, showing how the report looks\" src=\"https://allthingsempty.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/img_9e1a0405118a-1-1.jpeg\" title=\"Example report produced by the shortcut\"></p>\n<h2>Before importing this shortcut (Prerequsites)</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Have the <a href=\"https://www.mikebeas.com/updatekit/\">UpdateKit shortcut</a> installed on your device.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Things to do (wish list)</h2>\n<p>This shortcut is very new and as such is still a work in progress. I'm hoping to expand it significantly to offer (in my current order of preference):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Summary data on more activity types (walking inc. heart rate, cycling, exercise minutes);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Summary data on more health information (weight - inc. BMI, fat percentage; sleep, blood pressure; heart rate - inc. average, resting, sleeping, activity; active and resting energry, and HRV; vo2 max; respiratory rate)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Present health data with a high and low, including the relevant high/low date;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ability to choose custom report date ranges for the report (a specific date, a range of dates, last week/month/year, or since the dawn of time); and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ability to choose what specific activity and health data is shown.\n(PS: Just how to execute this really has me stumped - any ideas?)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Things it can't do</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Actually make you healthier and fitter.
