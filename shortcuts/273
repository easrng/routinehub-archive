When I have permission, I’ll publish the “add-ins” that others have done the heavy lifting in helping create my ‘vision’. So, in order for this to be most effective, you will need to have your most frequent destinations saved as contacts, complete with address. And make a calendar with your work schedules and appointments. Then I believe it truly becomes useful.</p>\n<p>To start: Activate with Siri or widget. Siri will ask “where to?” So long as your response contains the key words or names, it will then open up navigation with Maps to the address of your response. And start a preselected playlist. Example: if I respond with ‘work’, it will look for work in my contacts and immediately direct to work. If I respond with “you tell me” the it looks in my calendar for Appointments/work and tells me what’s next and how long it’ll take to get there. Asks you if you’re ready to go. If yes, navigation opens, otherwise the shortcut restarts. Preselected music plays when Nav starts. If questions, I’m on Reddit shortcuts u/jgibbs347</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Oct. 15, 2018, 5:53 p.m.</strong></p>"}
