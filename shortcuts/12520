Although the bug exists on iOS 15.0-15.4.1, it can not be abused (yet) since you need to be jailbroken at first to place the app in the /Applications folder. This bug does not exist on anything older than iOS 14.</p>\n<p>This shortcut is a GUI wrapper for my <a href=\"https://github.com/itsnebulalol/permasigner\">original script</a>, which makes a deb file for you based on an IPA. Tested with Taurine, but should work with many others.</p>\n<p>Based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/zhuowei/CoreTrustDemo/tree/resign_taurine\">resign_taurine branch of CoreTrustDemo</a>, please note that certificates are not copyrightable.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> unc0ver will probably fail to jailbreak. It works for some people but not everyone.</p>\n<h1>How to use</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Import the shortcut<ul>\n<li>Make sure to pay attention to the import questions</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Run the shortcut</li>\n<li>Choose one of the options and follow the prompts</li>\n<li>The app will install if you choose!<ul>\n<li>If you choose not to, it's in /var/mobile/.permasigner/src/output</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Credits</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LinusHenze\">Linus Henze</a> for the bug</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/zhuowei\">zhuowei</a> for the original Taurine script</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/RexSonic\">RexSonic</a> for the fix and a lot of help</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/verygenericname\">verygenericname</a> for the ldid downloader</li>\n<li>anyone who sent a pull request or issue!
