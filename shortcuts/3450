{"id":"3450","name":"Delay by Seconds","tagline":"Allows Shortcuts to run near indefinitely (iOS 12)","icon":"ios12 c4271458815 g59712","latest":"10486","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Shortcuts will usually stop your program after four or five minutes, but this will stop that. Use a number block with the number of seconds you would like to wait, then call this Shortcut from a Run Shortcut block. Tested up to 10 minutes in the background, but can theoretically run indefinitely. Also see my Delay by Minutes to delay by minutes instead of seconds.</p>\n<p>Important: This has shown to only be effective on iOS 12. More testing will be done upon the primary release of iOS 13.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - Sept. 1, 2019, 3:29 a.m.</strong></p>"}
