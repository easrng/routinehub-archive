So I created a shortcut that selects each name I've added in the text box action and selects a random day within the next 7 days along with a random time between 9 am to 8 pm to alert me to check in on that person. </p>\n<p>Can be used however you feel to use it and the number of days ahead can be modified. Requires the following two apps to work correctly. </p>\n<p>I've also set this to automate every Friday at 9 am to run and create the reminders for the next 7 days without even having to think about it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.02 - March 17, 2022, 4:07 p.m.</strong></p><p>Simplified RegEx and added an alert to notify user if no default app has been assigned. <br><br>Thanks again to mvan231 for the RegEx skills.</p>"}
