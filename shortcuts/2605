Once it backs them up, you have the option of deleting the images from your phone, which should save you quite a bit of storage. </p>\n<p>If you select no, fear not. The Shortcut will remember the images it backed up last time it ran and continues from there only picking new pictures and videos to back up.</p>\n<p>I always recommend you back up your pictures using multiple sources, and I am in no way liable for any data loss or damage as a result of this Shortcut. This Shortcut has been tested extensively using multiple iPhone 7â€™s and an iPhone X with no issues.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - May 7, 2019, 10:01 a.m.</strong></p>"}
