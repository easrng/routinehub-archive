Now you can. Plus, you will have it in a nice playlist ready to share with others. <em>Note: if you want to know how many times you have played a particular song last week, this shortcut won’t give you the answer.</em></p>\n<p>The playlist will be saved in your library, and you can change the name of the author of the playlist, so you are not longer limited to your Apple Music Name.</p>\n<p>If later you want to change the author name of the playlist, there is a comment at the beginning of the shortcut explaining how.</p>\n<p>I personally use it with an automation each week just for fun. Hope you like it!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"iPad\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/wXlSdlt.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Graphics made with <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911\">MediaKit</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Contact:</strong> You can find me on the r/Shortcuts’ Discord as roger.gal</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Dec. 19, 2020, 3:08 p.m.</strong></p>"}
