The shortcut will format your caption and add it back to the clipboard. </p>\n<p>If you’d rather draft your post in the shortcut itself, you can do that as well. When you’re ready to format, tap OK. </p>\n<p>In either case, make sure your caption is written like the sample below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>First line of caption. </p>\n<p>Second line of caption. </p>\n<p>A third line and so on....</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is to say with a line break exactly where you want one to be in your caption.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Oct. 10, 2019, 11:01 p.m.</strong></p><p>Improved regex so you can now do even less work. <br><br>Now supports line breaks with AND without a clean line between them, meaning you can do things like this:<br><br>First line text.<br>Second line text. <br><br>And it will get formatted correctly. <br><br>Also, on occasion, if you had a trailing space after a period, that wouldn’t get formatted correctly. I’ve solved that issue as well.</p>"}
