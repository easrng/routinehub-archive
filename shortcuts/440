It automatically will use any photo taken in the past few minutes (default 2) if you're not chosing to take a photo in the shortcut.</p>\n<p>When parking you'll be given a choice of:</p>\n<p>• Here\n• Here with Note\n• Here with Photo\n• Garage with Level\n• Garage with Level &amp; Space\n• Lot with Zone\n• Lot with Zone &amp; Space</p>\n<p>If you choose a garage or a lot, you'll be given a list of parking facilities within 1 km to choose from, or you can enter your own.  Each of the garage or lot choices then has a preset menu to choose from, so you don't have to type levels or zones. If you're entering a space, you type it with the number keyboard.</p>\n<p>When you park, you'll be shown a notification. When you Find Car, you'll see an alert with the info you entered, and the estimated walking time. If there's a valid photo, you'll be shown that first, with the option to delete it. Of course, you can then get directions, either with Apple Maps or Google Maps.</p>\n<p><strong>Screenshots</strong>\n• <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/VCjQfwf.png\">Parking Choices</a>\n• <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/92T9Pux.png\">Garage/Lot Menu</a>\n• <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/HWpFepB.png\">Parked Notification</a>\n• <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/YQsTBOL.png\">Find Car Alert</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Nov. 1, 2018, 1:45 a.m.</strong></p><p>• fixed error when parking with no photos on camera roll<br>• changed time from 2&gt;3 min. before parking that the last picture taken wil be linked to your parking spot.</p>"}
