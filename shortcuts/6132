It was created by Empraetorius on freesound.org. You can Check the sound's page here.\nhttps://freesound.org/people/empraetorius/sounds/201251/\nThis shortcut has a number between one and two, being two being tails, using the if action.\nThe idea is to have number one being heads, while to is tales.\nExample, if random number is one, it will be heads. Otherwise, it will land on tails. Instead of doing if random number is two, land on tails, I just used otherwise, land on tails.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Aug. 4, 2020, 6:16 p.m.</strong></p>"}
