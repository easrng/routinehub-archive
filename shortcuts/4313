ROT13 is a special case of the <em>Caesar cipher</em> which was developed in ancient Rome.</p>\n<p>Because there are 26 letters (2×13) in the basic Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same algorithm is applied, so <strong>the same action can be used for encoding and decoding</strong>. The algorithm provides virtually no cryptographic security, and is often cited as a <em>canonical example of <strong>weak encryption</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/ROT13_table_with_example.svg/475px-ROT13_table_with_example.svg.png\"></p>\n<p>ROT13 is used in online forums as a means of <strong>hiding</strong> spoilers, punchlines, puzzle solutions, and offensive materials from the casual glance. </p>\n<p>This shortcut also implements several variants of this idea: <strong>ROT5</strong> (only digits), <strong>ROT18</strong> (letters and digits), and <strong>ROT47</strong> (using all the printable ASCII).</p>\n<p>Version 2.0 was made <strong>compatible with iOS 12</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/atnbueno/shortcuts_es/blob/4cbc5b568c82045786b8639984725308f5c374c0/ScPL/ROT13.scpl\">using ScPL</a>), and it supports the <strong>use of diacritics</strong> (not really an issue in English, but a nice extra for other languages).</p>\n<h4>How it works</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>By default the shortcut converts whatever text is <strong>shared</strong> with it. If the shortcut receives no input, the user will be asked for it, while being offered the contents of the clipboard as initial text.</li>\n<li>If you <strong>don't want</strong> any of the encodings offered, delete the corresponding entry in the dictionary. As long as there is more than one encoding, the user will be <strong>asked</strong> to select one of the outputs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>¡También disponible en español!</h6>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/0e639d79fc7e420a97e37d5fc9b8c6d7\">ROT13 [es] 2.0.2</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.0.2 - June 10, 2022, 5:56 p.m.</strong></p><p>Fixed issue when input included the “`” or “\\” characters</p>"}
