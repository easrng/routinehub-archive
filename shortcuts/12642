You can change the sort order clicking multiple times on the columns headers (3 states for each column: <strong>ascending, descending and original sort</strong>).    </li>\n<li>The generated table is a standalone html file. You can copy, export or print it.  </li>\n<li>Enjoy! :D  </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Known Issues</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>To get the informations on the files iOS needs to first download them behind the scenes (don't ask me why!). If the selected files are currently not in the iCloud Drive local cache, the system will try to download them and this will make the shortcut to slow down or (when the number of files is big) even crash completely. In those cases just wait until iOS had finished to synch the files locally and then run the shortcut again.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Companions</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>If you need to compute the size of a folder, you can use my other shortcut <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12460/\"><strong>Total Size Of Folder</strong></a>.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>REQUIREMENTS</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>none  </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>INFO</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>First Release: 2022-07-27 v1.0.0  </li>\n<li>Latest Release: 2022-08-30 v1.1.3  </li>\n<li>Author: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fremenmuaddib/\">u/fremenmuaddib</a>  </li>\n<li>This shortcut is canonically available on RoutineHub at https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12642/</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1.3 - Aug. 30, 2022, 5:31 p.m.</strong></p><p>- Fixed a bug that caused wrong file names for txt files</p>"}
