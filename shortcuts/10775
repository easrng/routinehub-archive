They’re a testament to Federico’s diligence and huge contribution to personal automation with iOS… but they’re also just extra text.</li>\n<li>I replaced the <code>Find Photos Where</code> action with <code>Get Latest Photos</code> with the <code>Include Screenshots</code> toggle ON and the retrieval limit set to just one. </li>\n<li>I deleted the entire export preferences menu and replaced it with actions that save the result both to a specific Photos folder for frames and a corresponding iCloud Drive folder.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"Speedy Frames\" src=\"https://i.snap.as/nszXla7t.png\"></p>\n<p>The resulting shortcut takes around 5-7 seconds to produce a single mocked up frame on my iPhone 12 Pro Max running iOS 15.3 beta after it’s triggered, and I think most of that is spent displaying the requisite notifications.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.11 - Feb. 2, 2022, 6:54 a.m.</strong></p><p>Add notification sound.</p>"}
