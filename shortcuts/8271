However, the website has the functionality of adding a custom timestamp to the link. This makes it so when the link is clicked, the video starts at a certain time instead of the beginning. The YouTube App is missing this functionality, and this shortcut adds it back.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.0 - Feb. 4, 2021, 1 a.m.</strong></p><p>1. Shortcut now works if the youtube link is copied to your clipboard and you access the shortcut directly from the shortcuts app. Before this version, it only worked if you ran the shortcut from the share sheet on the youtube app.<br>2. Shortcut now works whether the youtube link is expanded or not</p>"}
