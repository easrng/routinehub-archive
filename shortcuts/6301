It incorporates 100 popular male and female names, and uses fruit names as last names, plus three random digits.</p>\n<p>Be safe online. Keep your real name for those who matter.\n<br><br></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Clean Interface\" src=\"https://imgur.com/bQ2jFaF.png\"></p>\n<h3>Genders</h3>\n\n<p>You can choose between male and female names.</p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Genders\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Pj96BND/IMG-3842.png\">\n<br><br>\n</p><h3>Private</h3>\nUsernames are generated locally. So no logs and no connection to servers (with the exception of RoutineHub, which is used to update the shortcut and nothing more).<p></p>\n<p><br><br>\n</p><h3>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h3><p></p>\n<p>AnonyGram and Download has an integrated update mechanism called Swing Updater[E]. Thanks to the embedded updater, this shortcut does not require any external updater shortcut. The shortcut checks for updates itself once per day, so you'll always be up to date and never miss an update.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.23 - Jan. 13, 2021, 8:55 a.m.</strong></p><p>â€¢ slightly improved speed </p>"}
