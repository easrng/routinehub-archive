Normally you would have to click share, copy the link, find the right website, paste the link, click download, and then click download again to actually download it. With this shortcut, all you have to do is click share and then run the shortcut.</p>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently doesn't work on i.redd.it posts, I'm not sure why yet. Don't expect this to be fixed soon since it's probably an issue with Reddit itself</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.3 - June 3, 2021, 5:54 p.m.</strong></p><p>- The Shortcut now sends an alert instead of a notification if you have Do Not Disturb turned on<br><br>- The Shortcut now also no longer opens the link in a browser, everything happens in the background<br><br>- You need to download Data Jar to use the Shortcut now. If you don’t want to download it and don’t care about being notified of the progress of the shortcut, you can just download the previous version</p>"}
