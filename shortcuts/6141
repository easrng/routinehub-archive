Use this version only if you want to test new features and add feedback.\nClick the get shortcut button at the bottom. The supported versions are, 12-12.5.5 unsupported, 13-14.8 full support, and iOS 15, minimal support. The reason iOS 12 is not supported is that this shortcut was built with iOS 13 and updated with iOS 14. iOS 12 support will be coming in the near future. Please use the BETA version of the shortcut if you want to use this shortcut with iOS 12 for now.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>4.3.6 - March 27, 2022, 7:32 p.m.</strong></p><p>Properly fixed QuickUpdate and turned off show while running on iOS 13.
