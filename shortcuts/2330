{"id":"2330","name":"Parking Recall","tagline":"Remember where you parked with the help of rich notifications","icon":"ios12 c1440408063 g59719","latest":"7418","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><img alt=\"Screensnip of rich notification\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dRq1bs4.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Record your location when you park, along with an optional note or photo. You'll immediately get a rich notification via the IFTTT app, or you can schedule the notification to come later (via Google Calendar and IFTTT). Tap on the notification to get walking directions back to your car in Google Maps, or tap and hold on the image to quickly glance at the map (or your photo, if you took one). See the note below.</p>\n<p>If you accidentally dismiss the notification or aren't connected to mobile data when the scheduled notification comes, just run the shortcut to get walking directions to the last saved location (and issue a new instance of the rich notification so you can see the note and saved static map or photo).</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Parking Recall requires DropBox, IFTTT, and Google Maps to be installed on your phone, and also requires that you create two IFTTT applets (scroll to bottom of description for info). You'll also need API keys for Google Maps Static API and IFTTT WebHooks. Finally, you'll need a Google Calendar account set up in iOS (i.e., via the Passwords and Accounts settings). The shortcut will walk you through adding the API keys and IFTTT integrations on first run.</p>\n<p>Parking Recall includes UpdateKit support.</p>\n<h3>Screenshots</h3>\n<p><em>Expanded rich notification with static map (auto-generated using Google Maps Static API)</em>\n<img alt=\"Screenshot of expanded rich map notification\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XyfjSfO.jpg\"></p>\n<p><em>Expanded rich notification with photo reference for parking spot</em>\n<img alt=\"Screenshot of expanded rich photo notification\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pakpJup.jpg\"></p>\n<p><em>Single menu for all options for recording your location</em>\n<img alt=\"Screenshot of menu\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Pds7QDh.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>IFTTT Applets</h3>\n<p>IFTTT <a href=\"https://help.ifttt.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010194447-Can-I-publish-or-share-an-Applet-\">no longer allows users to share their applets</a>, so you'll need to recreate the applets that make this shortcut work. Below you will find screenshots showing how to set up these applets. It isn't important what you call your applets, but please note these two key facts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Be sure that the shortcut and the Scheduled Notification For Parking Spot applet both reference the name of the same Google Calendar (the calendar in the screenshot is called \"Personal\").</li>\n<li>Be sure that the Send Rich Notification from iOS Shortcut applet is set up to expect a WebHooks trigger named <code>run_shortcut</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h6>Send Rich Notification from iOS Shortcut</h6>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of IFTTT settings for Send Rich Notification from iOS Shortcut\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dpWmit8.png\"></p>\n<h6>Scheduled Notification For Parking Spot</h6>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of IFTTT settings for Scheduled Notification For Parking Spot\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZD3IwY5.png\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>3 - April 21, 2019, 10:21 p.m.</strong></p><p>Updated first-run instructions to show how to set up required IFTTT applets</p>"}
