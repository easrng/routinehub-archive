Posting it now since I have seen a few requests on reddit for such a thing.</p>\n<p>Posting to Discord can be done in two ways: via WebHook, and via your User/Bot Token to post as your actual account or as a bot.</p>\n<h3>WebHook:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Safe, and abides by the Discord ToS</li>\n<li>Doesn't require any ChannelID's or anything, just the WebHook URL!</li>\n<li>Requires server WebHook access (Usually Admin/Owner)</li>\n<li>Posts on behalf of the WebHook, which can be set-up with any custom name etc, that can be changed on the fly by the shortcut itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>BotToken</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Safe, and abides by the Discord ToS</li>\n<li>Requires a bot that you have created and set-up previously in your server</li>\n<li>Requires said bot's BotToken, which is a unique token that allows anyone with it to access the bot.</li>\n<li>Requires ChannelID to specify what channel to post to - your bot must have the ability to message in the channel you are trying to post to. </li>\n<li>This is the most advanced and hard to set-up - If you're doing this, you likely already know how to make this shortcut anyways. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>UserToken</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This is against the Discord ToS, but provided as it is the same method as Bot Tokens</li>\n<li>Requires your UserToken (<a href=\"https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs#how-to-get-a-user-token\">how-to</a>), which is a process to get (Note: Your personal UserToken give full access to your account, guard it!)</li>\n<li>Requires ChannelID to specify what channel to post to - your account must have the ability to message in the channel you are trying to post to. </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Set-Up</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>WebHook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Setup a WebHook on your server (<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks\">Intro to WebHooks</a>)</li>\n<li>Fill in the WebHook URL into the dictionary in the shortcut.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>User/Bot Token</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Input your User or Bot Token into the userbotToken field of the dictionary (<a href=\"https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs#how-to-get-a-user-token\">How to get your User/Bot Token</a>)</li>\n<li>Input the Channel ID of the channel you would like to send your message to in the dictionary (<a href=\"https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs#how-to-get-a-server-id-or-a-server-channel-id\">How to get a channel ID</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's it, set up what you want your message to be, or create a complex series of actions to make a dynamic message, and you're good to send it!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.01 - Feb. 24, 2021, 3:11 a.m.</strong></p><p>Release (Fixed image)</p>"}
