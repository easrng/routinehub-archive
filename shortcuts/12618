You will also need to specify the directory in which you'd like the .zip files to live momentarily until they are deleted by the final <a href=\"https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/delete-files/\">Delete Files</a> action after being extracted.</p>\n<p>Be advised: upon running the Shortcut, you will need to agree (select <code>OK</code>) to two <a href=\"https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/show-alert/\">Show Alert</a> prompts at run:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is going to take a good long while but - especially if you can leave your device to it and do something else - it SHOULD complete its full, 343-tape task without interruption.\nI would highly recommend you set Auto-Lock to <code>Never</code> on your device to ensure the best chances of successful completion. This shortcut is about to offer to open the settings page for you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You will then be asked if you'd like to proceed to the Auto-Lock view in Settings. A <a href=\"https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/wait-to-return/\">Wait to Return</a> flow should ensure that the process proceed as soon as you (manually, sorry) return back to the Shortcuts app.</p>\n<p>Set a directory into which the .zip archive files can (temporarily) live as they are extracted. They will be deleted. (Required.)\nSet the final directory into which you'd like the extracted per-chapter folders to be placed.
