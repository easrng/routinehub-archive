Starting with <strong>iOS 14.6 beta 3</strong> (18F5065a), I no longer see this bug. To confirm that your shortcuts are <em>clean</em>, try running this shortcut on your updated system. If you do not see an error, your set of shortcuts have been successfully written to iCloud.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZI10mhf.png\"></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YpEp14G.png\"></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sQ515AR.png\"></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/t3rDLLR.png\"></p>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>I recently discovered that <em>17</em> of my <em>555</em> shortcuts in my <em>Shortcuts App Library</em> cannot be written to my <em>iCloud Drive</em>. This is a new bug that <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/me6gd8/ios_145_beta_5_cannot_write_some_shortcuts_to_the/\">I first discovered with iPadOS 14.5 betas</a>. Unfortunately the bug has not beeen resolved with <strong>iPadOS 14.5 Release Candidate (18E199)</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Identify iOS 14.5 Problematic Shortcuts</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This shortcut is used to attempt to write every shortcut in the <em>Shortcuts App Library</em> to an <em>iCloud Drive</em> folder. Due to an iPadOS 14.5 RC bug, when this is attempted for some shortcuts, the Shortcuts app generates an error: <strong>An error occurred in the destination for the data</strong></p>\n<p>From the error dialog, select OK and this shortcut will abort. When it does run it again; it will skip the problematic shortcut that caused the abort and continue saving shortcuts in the <em>Shortcuts App Library</em> until another problematic shortcut is encountered. Continue restarting this shortcut until it completes without an error dialog.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When <strong>Identify iOS 14.5 Problematic Shortcuts</strong> is used as described above, it creates three text files that can be used if needed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shortcuts • All in Library.txt</li>\n<li>Shortcuts • Successfully Saved.txt</li>\n<li>Shortcuts • Error Saving.txt</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/54cd089ecde44c5dbf865a4af4f24356\">My Safe Shortcuts</a> is simple shortcut that includes logic to create a list of all shortcuts excluding the entries in <strong>Shortcuts • Error Saving.txt</strong>.</p>\n<h3>More About the iPadOS 14.5 RC Bug</h3>\n<p>As I mentioned above, during my troubleshooting I discovered <em>17</em> problematic shortcuts in my <em>Shortcuts App Library</em>. One common characteristic is that each contained one or more large dictionaries. I copied one of the shortcuts and stripped out other actions to create a small shortcut that can be used to reproduce the error: <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/721e9fcc437643fca563576c50c1e141\">Problematic Shortcut - iOS 14.5</a>.</p>\n<p>I've reported this problem <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/\">to Apple</a> (<strong>FB9056625</strong>).
