Simple say “Hey Siri, Send a emergency alert” </p>\n<p>It will send a custom emergency message to the contacts you have setup. It will then send a rough location. (because rough is faster) and then follow up with more accurate location details.</p>\n<p>This shortcut is designed to work hands free. Make sure you run it once before so that it has any permissions it may need.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to leave a comment with and feedback or suggestions.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.1 - July 28, 2022, 11:57 a.m.</strong></p>"}
