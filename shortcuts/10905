It will list a couple of parking garages (you can edit this list), from which you will pick one. It will then list numbers, and you will pick one corresponding to the floor you have parked on. It will then list North, South, East . . . and you will pick where on that floor you have parked. This shortcut saves all this information automatically into a reminder, including the date and time. </p>\n<p>When you need to drive again (maybe a few days later), run this same shortcut, and it will open your reminders app, where you can see where/when exactly you last parked.</p>\n<p>(This shortcut does delete all previous reminders to prevent the accumulation of parking spots/times).</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>15.1.1 - Jan. 22, 2022, 8:31 p.m.</strong></p>"}
