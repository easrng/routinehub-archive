It is recommended to use the jailbreak tweak “<a href=\"https://repo.packix.com/package/jp.soh.jailbreakupdatechecker/\">Jailbreak Update Checker</a>” along-side with this shortcut. This shortcut does not fully reboot a user’s device, but rather does a userspace reboot. It’s <em>almost</em> like a full device reboot, but keeps the kernel alive to preserve the jailbroken device state. The Taurine logo you may see is the splash screen for the jailbreak.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.6 - June 8, 2021, 11:18 p.m.</strong></p><p>- Added jailbreak package manager themed default icons across menu items in the shortcut.
