Starting with <strong>iOS 14.6 beta 3</strong> (18F5065a), I no longer see this bug. To confirm that your shortcuts are <em>clean</em>, try running <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9007/\">Identify iOS 14.5 Problematic Shortcuts</a> on your updated system. If you do not see an error, your set of shortcuts have been successfully written to iCloud.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/F0tbZvS.png\"></p>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p><strong>BART</strong> is a shortcut that can back up, archive, and restore shortcuts in the <em>Shortcuts</em> app <em>Library</em>, also known as <em>My Shortcuts</em>. It is designed to be full-featured, yet simple and fast to use. In fact, most of the information below can be easily discovered by simply running the shortcut*. However if you prefer to read instructions and/or learn some of the finer points of <strong>BART</strong>, the following is for you.</p>\n<p>* There are a few significant exceptions. For example, running <strong>BART</strong> from another shortcut, a very powerful yet easy to use feature, is not discoverable (unless you peer into the actions of the <strong>BART</strong> ðŸ˜€ ). Therefore, even if you have used the interactive features of <strong>BART</strong>, you'll find some very useful information beginning with the section <strong>Running BART From Another Shortcut</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>A video overview of <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4069\">BART</a> is available <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5PEwdyatL4KtxN5kU3gJRyZyRjG5YSXa\">here</a>. Changes for <strong>Version 2.0</strong> are highlighted in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Yb1SwY7N7xo\">this video</a>.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>So what's the point?</h3>\n<p><em>Short answer:</em> <strong>It's always good to back up your work!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Long answer:</em> <em>Stuff</em> happens! On occasion, the iOS <em>Shortcuts</em> app will display an error indicating that the database is corrupt. If <em>iCloud Sync</em> (one of the <em>Shortcuts</em> app settings) is set, the <em>Shortcuts</em> app attempts to recreate <em>My Shortcuts</em> after the error dialog is dismissed. Depending on the circumstances, this restoration can range from a <em>complete recovery</em> to a <em>complete loss</em> of all of the shortcuts in <em>My Shortcuts</em>. If not a <em>complete recovery</em>, shortcut backups are indispensable. Backups are also valuable during more common and frequent events, e.g., if a shortcut is mistakenly modified or deleted.</p>\n<p>In addition to shortcut <em>protection</em>, backups can be employed to <em>manage</em> shortcuts. For example, a user might find a group of shortcuts that are useful occasionally, but not want to clutter <em>My Shortcuts</em> with these rarely used shortcuts. Such shortcuts could be <em>archived</em> and <em>restored</em> when needed.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>BART Main Menu</h3>\n<p>This section includes a short description for each <em>Shortcut Operation</em> on the <strong>BART</strong> main menu.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Xo8Gl9E.png\"></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nGEPr9N.png\">  <strong>Save Snapshot of My Shortcuts</strong> saves a copy of all shortcuts in <em>My Shortcuts</em> to the <em>snapshot</em> folder: /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/<strong>BART/Snapshot/</strong>. All files previously in this folder are deleted before the shortcuts are copied to this folder. This is the fastest and simplest way to <em>back up</em> <em>My Shortcuts</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tZoJmhU.png\"> <strong>Back Up Selected</strong> saves copy of one or more selected shortcuts in <em>My Shortcuts</em> to the <em>backup</em> folder: /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/<strong>BART/Backup/</strong>. Shortcuts files in the folder <strong>are written over</strong> if the selection includes shortcuts with the same names. </p>\n<p>Shortcuts previously backed up to the <em>backup</em> folder and later deleted from <em>My Shortcuts</em> are <strong>not</strong> automatically deleted from the <em>backup</em> folder. Thus over time, the <em>backup</em> folder will likely contain a superset of shortcuts from <em>My Shortcuts</em>. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QgoP3qB.png\"> <strong>Archive All</strong> creates a zip archive of the shortcuts in <em>My Shortcuts</em> and saves the file to the <em>archive</em> folder: /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/<strong>BART/Archive/</strong>. The archive is named based on the date/time and #<em>x</em> (where <em>x</em> is the number of shortcuts in the new zip archive). For example, the following archive would include <em>102</em> shortcuts: 2019-12-10-073522_#102.zip.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/I4QdpVw.png\"> <strong>Archive Selected</strong> creates a zip archive of one or more <em>selected</em> shortcuts in <em>My Shortcuts</em> and saves the file to the <em>archive</em> folder: /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/<strong>BART/Archive/</strong>. The archive is named based on the date/time and either: a) #<em>x</em> (where <em>x</em> is a number <em>2</em> to <em>n</em> indicating the number of contained shortcuts), or b) <em>shortcutname</em> (if only <em>one</em> shortcut is selected). For example, the following archive would include <em>102</em> shortcuts: 2019-12-10-073522_#102.zip and the following would include one shortcut named <em>xyz</em>: 2019-12-10-073522_xyz.zip.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Cs2yfeU.png\"> <strong>Restore</strong> <em>(from a selected folder)</em> displays a list of <em>specified</em> folders that contain shortcut files. Once the user selects one of the folders, a second selection list is displayed with all of the shortcuts within the folder. If the user selects one or more of these shortcuts, they are restored to <em>My Shortcuts</em>.</p>\n<p>By default, the folder list contains three folders in /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BART/Snapshot/</strong></li>\n<li><strong>BART/Backup/</strong></li>\n<li><strong>BART/Develop/</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any other folder in <strong>/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/</strong> can be added to the list by adding it to a <em>List action</em> within <strong>BART</strong>. This could be useful for users that have used another means to backup and/or organize shortcut backup files. <strong>Note: All folder entries are case-sensitive!</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/HhYFzW8.png\"> <strong>Restore</strong> <em>(from a zip archive)</em> displays a list of zip archives in the <em>archive</em> folder: /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/<strong>BART/Archive/</strong>. If a user selects one of the zip archives, the file is <em>unzipped</em> into a new subfolder in the <em>unarchive</em> folder: /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/<strong>BART/Unarchive/</strong>. For example, if the user selected 2019-12-10-073522_#102.zip the archive would be unzipped into the following: /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/BART/Unarchive/2019-12-10-073522_#102/. After the archive is unzipped, a second selection list is displayed with all of the shortcuts within the subfolder. If the user selects one or more shortcuts, they are restored to <em>My Shortcuts</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/o9BxY0B.png\"> <strong>Restore</strong> <em>(from an unarchive folder)</em> displays a list of subfolders in the <em>unarchive</em> folder. If a user selects one of the subfolders, a second selection list is displayed with all of the shortcuts within the subfolder. If the user selects one or more shortcuts, they are restored to <em>My Shortcuts</em>.</p>\n<p>This restoration operation would be used to recover a shortcut that was previously archived (using <strong>Archive All</strong> or <strong>Archive Selected</strong>) and then subsequently unzipped using the <strong>Restore</strong> <em>(from a zip archive)</em> operation.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6fgDrvZ.png\"> <strong>Restore One</strong> <em>(from a file browse)</em> will open a file selection dialog to allow the user to select a shortcut file. The selected shortcut will be restored to <em>My Shortcuts</em>.</p>\n<p>This restoration operation would likely be used infrequently as it is intended for files that were backed up prior to using <strong>BART</strong>. This method has the advantage of being more flexible in that the shortcut file can be located anywhere, not limited to <em>/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/</em>. The disadvantage of this method is that only one shortcut can be selected per file browse.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/HWlCWwX.png\"> <strong>Help</strong> displays this information.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Segregating Saved Files by iOS Device</h3>\n<p>By default, all files created by <strong>BART</strong> are saved exactly as described in the above sections. This is appropriate if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>only one iOS device is being used, or </li>\n<li>if multiple devices are being used and <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/sync-shortcuts-apdb3a4240b0/ios\">iCloud Sync</a> is ON for all devices (that use <strong>BART</strong>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Conversely in cases where multiple iOS devices are being used and <em>iCloud Sync</em> is not being used, it is recommended to segregate the <strong>BART</strong> files. This change can be made when <strong>BART</strong> is first downloaded or at anytime later using <strong>Settings</strong> -&gt; <strong>Customize Shortcut</strong>.</p>\n<p>If <em>segregation</em> is selected, the BART root folder becomes: /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/BART/<em>device_name</em>. For example, if the device name is <strong>My iPhone</strong>, the folders mentioned in the previous section would be subfolders of <strong>/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BART/My iPhone/Snapshot/</strong></li>\n<li><strong>BART/My iPhone/Backup/</strong></li>\n<li><strong>BART/My iPhone/Archive/</strong></li>\n<li><strong>BART/My iPhone/Unarchive/</strong></li>\n<li><strong>BART/My iPhone/Develop/</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>Shortcut and Workflow Files</h3>\n<p>Shortcut files saved to <em>iCloud Drive</em> by <strong>BART</strong> include a <em>shortcut</em> extension (e.g., xyz.shortcut). </p>\n<p>The <em>Shortcuts</em> app is an updated version of <em>Workflow</em>, a third-party iOS app that Apple acquired in 2017. Although similar, this app included <em>workflows</em>, not <em>shortcuts</em>. Workflow files included a <em>wflow</em> extension and, like shortcut files, can be restored using <strong>BART</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Restoring Shortcuts</h3>\n<p>With iOS 13.x, the <em>Shortcuts</em> app cannot restore/import a shortcut file directly from <em>iCloud Drive</em>. (This limitation did not exist with the iOS <em>Workflow</em> app, but may have been added by Apple for security reasons.) Therefore to restore/import a shortcut, the shortcut file must first be uploaded to iCloud (in a public area established by Apple that is reserved for shortcuts). Once uploaded, a shortcut file can then be restored/imported within Safari by opening an iCloud link (to the uploaded shortcut file).</p>\n<p><strong>BART</strong> automates the process described above. However once the link is opened in Safari, a user must complete the final step by selecting blue <em>Get Shortcut</em> button that appears on the shorcut's Safari page. Because of a limitation with the <em>Shortcuts</em> app, this final step cannot be completed if a shortcut is still running. Due to these constraints, only one shortcut can be automatically restored/imported <em>for each run</em> of <strong>BART</strong> (or any similar restoration shortcut). Therefore if the user selects more than one shortcut to restore, the first one will be restored during that run of <strong>BART</strong>; shortcuts 2 to <em>n</em> will be queued up and ready to be restored, one at a time, with each subsequent run of <strong>BART</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Optional Management of iCloud Folders</h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, <em>snapshot</em>, <em>backup</em>, and <em>archive</em> files are saved to <em>/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/</em> subfolders, specifically <strong>BART/Snapshot/</strong>, <strong>BART/Backup/</strong>, and <strong>BART/Archive/</strong>, respectively. In addition, <strong>BART/Develop/</strong> houses copies of shortcuts that are modified using the <strong>Develop</strong> operation. </p>\n<p>In general, the contents of these folders are managed automatically by <strong>BART</strong>, but in some cases the contents can be managed manually using the iOS <em>Files</em> app or the macOS <em>Finder</em>. Specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Shortcuts no longer needed but previously backed up to <strong>BART/Backup/</strong> can be manually deleted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Shortcuts files (*.shortcut), and even old Workflow files (*.wflow), can be manually added to <strong>BART/Backup/</strong>. These shortcuts (or workflows) can be restored using the <strong>Restore</strong> <em>(from a selected folder)</em> operation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As an alternative to the above bullet, old <em>Shortcuts</em> app (or <em>Workflow</em> app) backups could be managed in a separate folder(s) within <em>/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/</em>. Files in this folder(s) can be restored using :</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Restore One</strong> <em>(from a file browse)</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Restore</strong> (from a selected folder). In this case, the <em>/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/</em> subfolder(s) would need to be added to the folder list using the <em>List</em> action within the shortcut. This list appears near the top of <strong>BART</strong> and includes a preceding comment. <strong>Note: All folder entries are case-sensitive!</strong></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unneeded zip archive files in <strong>BART/Archive/</strong> can be deleted when they are no longer needed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unneeded copies of shortcuts in <strong>BART/Develop/</strong> can be deleted when they are no longer needed; however, older copies will be <em>automatically</em> purged per the <strong>Copies</strong> value when using the _Develop__ operation. See <strong>Protection While Developing or Modifying Other Shortcuts</strong> for more information.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Older zip archives that include <em>shortcuts</em> (or even <em>workflows</em>), that may have been created by some other means, can be manually added to <strong>BART/Archive/</strong>. <strong>BART</strong> could then be used to process these archives just as it does for the archives that it creates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unarchive subfolders in <strong>BART/Unarchive/</strong> can be deleted (e.g., BART/Unarchive/2019-12-12-131131_#109). Also, shortcuts no longer needed can be individually deleted from these subfolders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Note: Shortcuts files can be copied <em>from</em> <strong>BART/Snapshot/</strong>, but since this folder is automatically managed by <strong>BART</strong>, the folder contents should not be modified.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>Running BART From Another Shortcut</h3>\n<p><strong>BART</strong> can be optionally started from another shortcut. This is also known as running <strong>BART</strong> in <em>Input</em> mode. This mode is useful because routine tasks can be automated and run consistently and quickly without user interaction with the <strong>BART</strong> main menu. </p>\n<p>Before continuing, download these simple, example shortcuts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2c17a3efcd204cb4838c024546141230\">Snapshpt âž¤ BART</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/30f1a26563d34f408a08a1f8bde01c16\">Archive ALL âž¤ BART</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/422a8dafff1541b9b61800cf2bae8faa\">Back Up âž¤ BART</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/11f1f074cc7542ba89e59e042f235bbf\">Archive âž¤ BART</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Snapshpt âž¤ BART</strong> and <strong>Archive ALL âž¤ BART</strong> can be used as is. For the other two, <em>Duplicate</em> them to create a copy that can be modified for your use. For example, copy <strong>Archive âž¤ BART</strong> and name it <strong>Archive (My Stuff) âž¤ BART</strong>. Then open <strong>Archive (My Stuff) âž¤ BART</strong> and continue reading.</p>\n<p>To run <strong>BART</strong> in this mode, the <em>calling</em> shortcut needs two actions: <strong>Dictionary</strong> and <strong>Run Shortcut</strong>. </p>\n<p>This <strong>Dictionary</strong> information is used by <strong>BART</strong> to determine the desired <strong>Operation</strong> (in lieu of  user interaction with the <strong>BART</strong> main menu). Depending on the <strong>BART Operation</strong>, the <strong>Dictionary</strong> action must have <em>one</em> or <em>two</em> <strong>Dictionary Items</strong>: [<em>item 1:</em> Key = <strong>Operation</strong>] or [<em>item 1:</em> Key = <strong>Operation</strong>; <em>item 2:</em> Key = <strong>Shortcut</strong>].</p>\n<p>The following <em>one-item</em> <strong>BART</strong> <strong><em>Operations</em></strong> are supported:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dictionary</strong>[<em>item 1:</em> Key = <strong>Operation</strong>, Text = <strong>Snapshot</strong>]</li>\n<li><strong>Dictionary</strong>[<em>item 1:</em> Key = <strong>Operation</strong>, Text = <strong>Archive All</strong>]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the following <em>two-item</em> <strong>BART</strong> <strong><em>Operations</em></strong> are also supported:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dictionary</strong>[<em>item 1:</em> Key = <strong>Operation</strong>, Text = <strong>Back Up</strong>; <em>item 2:</em> Key = <strong>Shortcut</strong>, Text = <em>shortcut_name</em>]</li>\n<li><strong>Dictionary</strong>[<em>item 1:</em> Key = <strong>Operation</strong>, Text = <strong>Archive</strong>; <em>item 2:</em> Key = <strong>Shortcut</strong>, Text = <em>shortcut_name</em>]]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As mentioned above, the above <strong>Dictionary</strong> action must precede the <strong>Run Shortcut</strong> action (specifically <strong>Run[BART]</strong>).</p>\n<p>Note 1: In the second group of <strong>BART Operations</strong>, a third key [Key = <strong>Shortcuts</strong>] can  replace the second key [Key = <strong>Shortcut</strong>]. This must be employed when <em>backing up</em> or <em>archiving</em> more than <em>one</em> shortcut with a single <strong>Dictionary</strong>/<strong>Run[BART]</strong> pair. In this case, the <strong>Dictionary</strong> <em>item</em> must be an <strong>Array</strong>, with Key = <strong>Shortcuts</strong>, and the <em>shortcut_names</em> are entered as separate <strong>Text</strong> array <em>items</em>.</p>\n<p>Note 2: If the <strong>Dictionary</strong> includes <strong>Shortcut</strong> (Text Key for <strong>1</strong> <em>shortcut_name</em>) and <strong>Shortcuts</strong> (Array Key for <strong>1 or more</strong> <em>shortcut_names</em>), all <em>shortcut names</em> will be used by <strong>BART</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Shortcut Automation</h3>\n<p>The shortcuts mentioned in the previous section, <strong>Running BART From Another Shortcut</strong>, are great candidates for the <em>Shortcuts</em> app <strong>Automation</strong>, also known as <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/intro-to-personal-automation-apd690170742/ios\">personal automation</a> in the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios\">Shortcuts User Guide</a>. As an example in the two following videos, <strong>Archive âž¤ BART</strong> is used to demonstrate how a full archive can be executed at 11:30/pm everyday.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/JP7yBttYIXs\">Configuring BART Automation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/_vWkivP_EZc\">Running BART Automation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>Protection While Developing or Modifying Other Shortcuts</h3>\n<p><strong>BART</strong> <em>Input</em> mode <em>operations</em> are discussed in a section above: <strong>Running BART From Another Shortcut</strong>. <strong>BART</strong> includes one additional <em>operation</em>: <strong>Develop</strong>. This operation, however, is unique in that it is <em>not available</em> when running <strong>BART</strong> interactively.</p>\n<p><strong>Develop</strong> is used to save a copy of a shortcut to the <em>develop</em> folder (/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/<strong>BART/Develop/</strong>) and then open the shortcut in the <em>Shortcut</em> app editor. Then, if needed (e.g., if a large block of actions is mistakenly deleted during the editing session), the saved copy can be restored using <strong>BART</strong> interactively (using <strong>Restore from selected folder</strong>).</p>\n<p>Before continuing, with the following shortcut, download, <em>Duplicate</em>, and open your copy: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ce4de6396e9f43c8be587254ba1929b2\">Develop âž¤ BART</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that this is an example that specifies three shortcuts: <strong>Brush Teeth Timer</strong>, <strong>Log Water</strong>, <strong>Tea Timer</strong>, selected in the example simply because they are available in the <em>Shortcuts</em> app <em>Gallery</em>. In the <strong>Dictionary</strong> action:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>item 1:</em> Key = <strong>Operation</strong>, Text = <strong>Develop</strong> </li>\n<li><em>item 2:</em> Key = <strong>Shortcut</strong>, Text = <strong>Log Water</strong></li>\n<li><em>item 3:</em> Key = <strong>Shortcuts</strong> (an <em>Array</em>), <em>item 1:</em> = <strong>Log Water</strong></li>\n<li><em>item 4:</em> Key = <strong>Copies</strong>, Number = <em>n</em></li>\n<li><em>item 5:</em> Key = <strong>Notify</strong>, Number = <strong>0</strong> or <strong>1</strong> (for <strong>No</strong> or <strong>Yes</strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>BART</strong> combines the single name in <strong>Shortcut</strong> key with the one or more names in <strong>Shortcuts</strong> key. After the keys are combined, if the list contains more than one shortcut name, <strong>BART</strong> will generate a <strong>Choose from List</strong> so that the  shortcut of interest at that particular time can be selected. This is helpful if there is a set of shortcuts that are regularly opened in the <em>Shortcuts</em> app editor.</p>\n<p>If only one shortcut name is specified, then <strong>BART</strong> will copy the shortcut and open it in the editor, i.e., the <strong>Choose from List</strong> will not appear.</p>\n<p><em>PRO Tip: One can specify commonly edited shortcuts in the __Shortcuts__ key. Then in a case where there will be many editing sessions with one shortcut, the __Shortcut__ key could be used and the __Shortcuts__ key could be renamed to __xShortcuts__. That way, the __Choose from List__ would be bypassed during the focused work on the single shortcut.</em></p>\n<p>The <strong>Copies</strong> key defines how many copies of a shortcut will be retained in the <em>develop</em> folder. If this key is not specified, the default value (defined in <strong>BART</strong>) will be used. Older copies in excess of this setting will be automatically deleted from the <em>develop</em> folder.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Notify</strong> key determines if <strong>BART</strong> will generate a notification when the shortcut is copied. If this key is not specified, <strong>BART</strong> will use its <strong>Suppress Notifications?</strong> Configuration Parameter to determine if a notification should be generated. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>iOS 14.5 Write Error</h3>\n<p>With iOS 14.5, Apple introduced a new bug that generates an error when some shortcuts are written to the local <em>iCloud Drive</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>An error occurred in the destination for the data.</strong>\nThe data couldn't be written because of a error in the destination for the data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If this error is observed during <strong>BART</strong> bakups and archives, download and run <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9007/\">Identify iOS 14.5 Problematic Shortcuts</a>. When all of the problematic shortcuts are identified, the names will be written to a file named <strong>Shortcuts â€¢ Error Saving.txt</strong> (folder: <strong>/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/\nIdentify iOS 14.5 Problematic Shortcuts/</strong>). Once this file is created, <strong>BART</strong> will use it and exclude the problematic shortcuts.</p>\n<p>Since entries in  <strong>Shortcuts â€¢ Error Saving.txt</strong> will not be saved by <strong>BART</strong>, you might want to manually back up these shortcuts using <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/share-shortcuts-apdf01f8c054/ios\">Copy iCloud Link</a> and saving the links (https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/<em>shortcut ID</em>) for use in the event it becomes necessary to restore one of the problematic shortcuts.</p>\n<p>If/when Apple addresses this bug, <strong>BART</strong> will be modified to ignore <strong>Shortcuts â€¢ Error Saving.txt</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Shortcut Testing</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4069\">BART</a>, Version 3.0, has been tested with the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>iOS 14.6 beta 2</li>\n<li>iPhone 8 Plus</li>\n<li>iPad Pro 10.5\"</li>\n<li><em>Shortcuts</em> app Libraries exceeding 1000 shortcuts </li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>Shortcut Development and Acknowledgments</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>BART</strong> is available exclusively at <a href=\"https://routinehub.co\">RoutineHub.co</a>.
