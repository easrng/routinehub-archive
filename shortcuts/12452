Hence, why the \ncode seems a bit redundant. But it works great and I’m super happy with it! </p>\n<p>I’ve been testing it with photos, videos, super long articles…and it’s just really convenient. Siri 2’s voice sounds almost human.</p>\n<p><strong>Creates an audio file from:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>PDF, Doc, any text-based file (you can do any file, but choose “Screen,” instead.</li>\n<li>News article, web page, anything on your screen</li>\n<li>Note, email, text</li>\n<li>Custom text, which you’ll have the option of within the shortcut</li>\n<li>Photos, and yes, even video! \n    <em>(The videos are definitely something to play around with. Very interesting, and\n      definitely sounds like something we weren’t intended to do haha)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pretty much anything that you can read, she’ll read it and make you your own audio book.</p>\n<p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There isn’t a way to dismiss the loading banner at the top when the audio is being processed. If you try to, the shortcut will probably exit. This only sucks because if you’re processing a super long article or something, it takes around 2-3 minutes sometimes. So, you just have to sit there. </li>\n<li>I chose Siri 2 because I think that she has the most natural sounding voice. However, if it’s not working for you, go into your settings for Siri <em>AND</em> your voice settings under Accessibility and be sure that you have the correct Siri downloaded, or whichever Siri you want to use.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’ll be done with the MacOS very shortly! I also have a few other helpful apps that are close to being done as well. I mentioned some of them in the comment inside the Shortcut. :)</p>\n<p>I welcome any feedback, tips, or ideas! I’m pretty new with Shortcuts but I’m excited to improve!<br>\n&lt;3<br>\nko-fi: ctzndwn<br>\nReddit: citizendown<br>\nDiscord: ctzndwn#3339</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - July 3, 2022, 3:18 p.m.</strong></p>"}
