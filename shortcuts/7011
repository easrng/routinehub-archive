{"id":"7011","name":"Custom Icons","tagline":"Custom Icons without opening Shortcuts app","icon":"ios14 c946986751 g61457","latest":"21814","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>How it works?</b></p>\n<p>With Custom Icons you can create icons with the advantage of not having to open the Shortcuts application first. This shortcut takes advantage of the possibility of creating webclips that directly open the application without opening Safari first (with some exceptions that I comment later). For this, Custom Icons creates profiles which when installed, add your generated icons to the desktop of your iPhone.</p>\n<p><b>Features</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multilanguage: Currently this shortcut supports Spanish and English.</li>\n<li>Icon groups: You can create icon groups to save time and maintain organization instead of install one profile for each icon.</li>\n<li>Icon backup: When you add more than one icon, the shortcut will automatically copy to your clipboard the list of icons that you are adding at that moment. In this way, if you make a mistake in any of the icons or simply cancel the shortcut by mistake, you will simply have to run the shortcut again and select the Import icons option to continue where you left off. Or if you wish, you can copy this clipboard in your favorite notes application, and it will only be enough to copy it again at the moment you want and start the shortcut to see the option to Import icons and continue adding more icons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>System applications</b></p>\n<p>For now, the plugin has the system applications option disabled, this is because the way the webclips work does not work in the same way in these applications. To explain this in a better way, I will comment on some technical aspects:</p>\n<p>To make an application open, first its bundle id is obtained, which is a url that identifies an application from any other, then there is the url scheme, which is a url specifically created within the application to be able to launch it from another place. The shortcut uses the first one to work, and if I detect that any application does not work this way, I add its url scheme to a list inside the shortcut that replaces the bundle id and thus be able to work.</p>\n<p>Well, unfortunately none of this works with system applications so they cannot be launched in the correct way. Some first need to open Safari to be launched later, even others first open Shortcuts, then Safari and finally the application, which makes it much worse.</p>\n<p>For this first version I will leave out the system applications, and in the next version only those that only need Safari and not Shortcuts will be available. For the rest of the applications, the only option available will be to create the icons using the well-known Shortcuts method.</p>\n<p><b>Unsupported apps</b></p>\n<p>Being the App Store the home of a huge number of applications, I cannot test each of the available applications, so there is always the possibility that some of them do not work, if you detect an application that does not work correctly, let me know in the comments and I will take care of checking if there is a solution, otherwise below I will leave the list of applications that simply do not work.</p>\n<p><b>Important</b></p>\n<p>When installing the profiles you will see that it will be shown as unsigned and to be installed it will ask for your password to give it authorization. Custom Icons does not collect any type of information from your device nor does it represent a risk to your privacy, and if privacy is very important to you, you can always analyze the shortcut in detail and verify that there is nothing that you consider risky for you.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Oct. 13, 2020, 3:09 a.m.</strong></p><p>- Fix a problem with the UUID in the profiles  generated that causes a replace of the previous icons.</p>"}
