When sharing outside the Apple ecosystem, like on Facebook, that is obnoxious.</p>\n<p>This shortcuts gets the real link to the original source and let’s you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>copy to clipboard</li>\n<li>post to Facebook</li>\n<li>Tweet</li>\n<li>Save to Diigo bookmark service</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Shortcut running\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/rktw32G/IMG-8-F752-B751221-1.jpg\" title=\"This Shortcut in action\"></p>\n<h2>Why this shortcut?</h2>\n<p>Of course it is possible to open an Apple News link without Apple News. However, there is an interstitial step and the URL is just ugly.</p>\n<p>The recipient can't tell where the URL goes to. For example, https://apple.news/ATdwN0w0SQzm3rm7TCqyxJw goes to https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/us/politics/supreme-court-lgbtq-rights.html But how would you know that? There are times I just prefer to share the <strong>real</strong> URL without disclosing to Apple any information.</p>\n<h1>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h1>\n<p>This shortcut has an integrated update mechanism called  <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\">Embed-a-Update</a>. Thanks to the embedded updater, it does not require any external updater shortcut. The shortcut checks for updates itself, so you'll never miss an update and it is super fast. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cpBjhE3_d.webp?maxwidth=1000&amp;fidelity=large\"></a>\n</p><p></p><p></p>\n<p>If this Shortcut doesn’t work as expected, you have suggestions, or an idea to improve it, let me know!</p>\n<p>See also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5575\">Save to Diigo</a> which saves a link to the <a href=\"https://diigo.com\">Diigo.com</a> bookmark service</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.3.0 - Sept. 20, 2020, 4:26 a.m.</strong></p><p>1.
