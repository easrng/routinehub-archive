It lets you select from 40 countries (though there's <a href=\"https://apis.justwatch.com/content/locales/state\">80 more country codes</a> I didn't include if yours isn't listed) and then pulls up to 50 of the most popular streaming platforms in your country, from which you can select the ones relevant to you.</p>\n<p>Once you've picked your options, the shortcut will pull posters for any titles that have been added in the past two days and then arrange them into a grid, outputting one grid per streaming platform to quick look.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Example output for Netflix (UK)\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/RCk6042.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>Bugs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>MacOS Quick look:</strong> On MacOS, if the shortcut returns multiple grids, quick look will do a spinny wheel indefinitely until you advance to the next image. Once you've done that you can cycle through the images without issue. I assume this is Shortcuts' patented brand of jankiness, but if anyone knows how to fix this, please do let me know :)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Large number of results:</strong> Because of the way streaming licensing works, on certain days the big streaming platforms will add a large number of titles in bulk. It's not ideal from a usability standpoint, but the shortcut will just make you a very big grid of posters, and you can zoom in and out to read it.</li>\n<li><strong>TV Shows:</strong> I didn't do a lot of testing on TV shows, but if you want those included as well you should be able to modify the API call to return Movies and TV shows (I'm not sure how to limit it to TV shows only) by changing \"movie\" in the content_types part of the url to \"show\". FWIW the Justwatch API returns each season of a show as a separate entity, so if a streaming platform adds fifteen seasons of something, you'll likely get fifteen of the same poster in a row.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Special thanks to u/gluebyte on reddit for patiently helping with some of the early teething issues!)</p>\n<p>Supports: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus, HBO Max, Paramount Plus, Peacock, Hulu and 100s more, including services specific to your country.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.5 - July 10, 2022, 1:45 p.m.</strong></p><p>- Significant improvement in execution speed<br>- Added fallback routine for titles with missing artwork.
