It's useful when you want to improve performance reducing the number of HTTP requests needed to load a webpage, or when you want to distribute a script/HTML page with some icons or other small images, but prefer to keep it in a single file.</p>\n<p>They can be used both in HTML, where the image data is placed inside src attribute, or in a CSS file, as a background image. This shortcut lets you select one of both ways or just gives you a raw data URI string without the additional code.</p>\n<p>Data URI in a CSS background property is currently supported by all major browsers and safe to use, unless you care about IE7 and older, and it that case you can add fallback background image property with path to ordinary image file for IE.\nData URI in a HTML image src property is not supported by IE/Edge.</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind it's usually not useful to embed anything larger than few kilobytes, as it will likely impact performance negatively because these images won't be cached by the browser if used in HTML and will increase CSS parsing time in used in CSS. If you have many small icons, consider using CSS sprites instead.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Oct. 1, 2019, 6:04 a.m.</strong></p><p>- Overall improvements.</p>"}
