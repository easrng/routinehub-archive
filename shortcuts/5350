It supports both iOS 12 and 13.</p>\n<h2>For users</h2>\n<p>This shortcut is needed for menu display in some Shortcuts. Please download it, so other Shortcuts may use it. Also, it helps provide your favorite creators with funds, so they can make more great Shortcuts. This shortcut will never make pop ups, noise, or other nuisances, just a small, non-intrusive menu item.</p>\n<h2>Developer docs</h2>\n<p>To use AdKit, follow these steps.</p>\n<h3>1. Make ad unit</h3>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https://a-ads.com\">a-ads.com</a>, and make a new ad unit, with the configuration as follows:</p>\n<p>Type: App</p>\n<p>Description: iOS Shortcut</p>\n<p>Ad type: Adaptive, Mixed</p>\n<h3>2. Make VCard menu</h3>\n<p>This is out of scope for these instructions. Google it.</p>\n<h3>3. Add to your shortcut</h3>\n<p>Make a dictionary.</p>\n<p>Add a string named “Unit ID” set to your a-ads unit ID.</p>\n<p>Add a string named “VCard Menu” set to your VCard menu, <strong>as text</strong>. (We do the VCard magic for you)</p>\n<p>Add a string called “Prompt” set to the menu title.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of dictionary\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/67nPWL5.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Next, add a”Run Shortcut” action, and set it to run AdKit.\n AdKit will return the user’s choice as a Contact. If the user clicked the ad, AdKit will wait for the user to come back, then it will show them the menu again.</p>\n<h3>4. ???</h3>\n<h3>5. Profit</h3>\n<p>IDK how this works. Check with a-ads.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.5 - May 21, 2020, 3:49 a.m.</strong></p><p>Copy for 13</p>"}
