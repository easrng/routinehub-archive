The farther you go in either direction away from the top left, each pixel will be +1 more in its value. This is what that would look like.</p>\n<p>0  1  2  3 . . .</p>\n<p>1</p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p>3\n.\n.\n.</p>\n<p>So now we have this table that has a range of numbers on it, now what? </p>\n<p>What we do now is we find if each number on the left factors into the number on the top, and if it does, we put a pixel or a mark there. That would look something like this </p>\n<p>0  1  2  3 . . .</p>\n<p>1  #  #  #</p>\n<p>2 —#</p>\n<p>3 ——#\n.\n.\n.</p>\n<p>Keep doing this process with a big enough table, and some patterns appear. I hope this description helps you understand what is going on with the program. Have fun and see how you can modify it to make different patterns!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>3 - Oct. 27, 2020, 12:17 a.m.</strong></p><p>Comments in the code, and an autofocus to the app function so that you don’t accidentally turn it off while its calculating</p>"}
