THIS IS ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO ONLY CARE ABOUT SPEED.</h1>\n\n<p>(Note: I recommend installing QuickUpdate instead) For those who want to update even quicker than QuickUpdate, here’s QuickUpdateEX (Extreme Edition.) The true fastest Updater on RoutineHub (or at least as of right now.) 2.0 has 11 actions, 1.0 has 8. Please keep in mind though that you will get notified for updates instead of taking you to the update page. Dictionary is the exact same as normal QuickUpdate, so every shortcut compatible with QuickUpdate is compatible with QuickUpdateEX, and every shortcut compatible with QuickUpdateEX is compatible with QuickUpdate. Please don’t tap on the shortcut, as it does not check for updates when tapped, unlike QuickUpdate. All Warnings apply as well.</p>\n<h2>QuickUpdate vs QuickUpdateEX</h2>\n\n<p>Providing URL to update- QuickUpdate &amp; QuickUpdateEX\n&amp;nbsp\nOffline Mode - QuickUpdate Only\n&amp;nbsp</p>\n<p>Tap to Check for Updates for QuickUpdate - QuickUpdate Only\nFrequent Updates - QuickUpdate Only\nMulti-Language Support - QuickUpdate Only\nChoice to Update - QuickUpdate Only</p>\n<p>Get Regular QuickUpdate here: routinehub.co/shortcut/2647</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>5.0 - May 3, 2021, 3 a.m.</strong></p><p>QuickUpdateEX 5.0 reduces the amount of actions to 4 actions, which is impressive considering the old 5 actions version was already the fastest on RoutineHub. It also adds multi-key support - meaning it supports RoutineHub ID, RH ID, RHID, ID, Current Version, and Version. Pretty good update in my opinion.</p>"}
