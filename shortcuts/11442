Starting somewhat from scratch, I have incorporated previously released workflows to allow Automation Control to become a one stop shop for managing your Shortcuts Automations.</p>\n<p>It’s a lengthy read so I would recommend reading through all the steps prior to beginning your actual setting up. I have included two demo automations as well as a blank one for you to attempt to modify.
