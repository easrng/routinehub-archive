{"id":"944","name":"Pomodoro Study Timer","tagline":"Study for 3 rounds before taking a long break. Fully automated! Supports UpdateKit","icon":"ios12 c4274264319 g59844","latest":"2628","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This fully automated Pomodoro study timer will go with the press of a button (or a Siri shortcut)! Simply set your preferences, and you’ll be good to go. It turns on do not disturb, sets your timer, your preferred volume of music, and gets your favorite focus music/noises going from a pre-selected playlist.  It also includes notifications to keep track of what round you’re on. </p>\n<p>Note: I use it from my phone while I study on my iPad because it requires the app to be open constantly, due to the need of the “wait” action. That’s why the brightness is dimmed: so the iPhone uses as little energy as possible. If you want to use it on the device you study with, just get rid of the “set brightness” action.\nThis was made before the addition of the “timer” functionality, so it’s a little messy. I may make updates to the mechanism in the future, but we’ll have to see.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Badges\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3QMzlEV.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Made by\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pi013nc.jpg\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - Nov. 26, 2018, 4:30 p.m.</strong></p><p>Got rid of UpdateKit for the sake of speed. </p>"}
