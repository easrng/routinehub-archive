They look and work the same way on any platform. Below is an iPad screenshot comparing two versions of a shortcut side by side. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5F3ND1d.jpg\"></li>\n<li>For better experience on small devices, it has an option to trim large text content from some actions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Block Folding<ul>\n<li>You can tap the header of an <em>if/repeat/menu</em> block or an action containing extra content to hide its nested actions or content. It helps you easily navigate shortcuts from others or long shortcuts you made but forgot how they work.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>All Info Shown on Screen<ul>\n<li>All action information—including action parameters, variable type casting, dictionary key paths, where magic variables come from—is displayed, making it easy to see what it is doing at a glance.</li>\n<li>You can take a screenshot and share as how-to snippets. Since Safari can take a tall screenshot in pdf, you can simply convert it to an image and share, rather than taking, cropping and stitching multiple screenshots. Screenshot below shows how web reviews deliver more info—<em>URL as Rich Text</em>—yet take up less space. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vvWwMCi.jpg\"></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Search<ul>\n<li>In a browser you can search any text, including action names, parameters, variable names and numbers, text/comment/list/dictionary content, etc.</li>\n<li>You can also see where magic variables come from by tapping them; the browser will jump to the source action, unfolding blocks if necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Some Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you choose <em>“Create Web Review (trim large content)”</em> from the shortcut menu, it will trim large text contained in text, comment, list and dictionary actions. It also trims long dictionary values (left in screenshot below). However, variables used in the content will all be displayed (right). <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4eNNFF7.png\"></li>\n<li>If a shortcut contains more than 300 actions, its top-level <em>if/repeat/menu</em> blocks will be folded by default to speed up page loading. Actions with very large content will also be folded.</li>\n<li>It will use the action id, instead of the name, of an action it does not recognize. This is handy for 3rd-party actions you do not have, because you can guess their functions by the id string and also see what parameters they have.</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>3.3 - Aug. 9, 2022, 8:57 a.m.</strong></p><p>2022-08-09<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Web Review: Base64-encoded plist data (e.g. in contacts and custom actions) is now decoded and displayed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Other small enhancements</p>"}
