Find your Network’s BSSID? Or somehow forgotten what your network is called? WMND Will help you! So what can WMND do?</p>\n<p>WMND can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Find your IP Address, weather it be IPv4 or IPv6.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>send your IP Address to your friends.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tell you your Network name and BSSID.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“So why would I need my IP Address?”\nWell, you can send it to your friends if a game requires it to join a server or room. You can use it yourself to mess with things on your WiFi.</p>\n<p>“Why can’t I just use an IP Address finder online?”\nGranted, you could do that too. It basically does the same thing. Although, some websites aren’t to be trusted and can take your information for the worst.</p>\n<p>Thank you for using WMND. This is the first and final version of this Shortcut.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>v1.0 - Feb. 18, 2020, 4:18 p.m.</strong></p>"}
