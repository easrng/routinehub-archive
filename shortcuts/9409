These shortcuts should allow a decent amount of variety, with the opportunity to see the same questions again for different answers on different days. The questions are spoken by Siri, then the user is prompted to think about their answers and tap to start recording an audio capture and tap again when done. The linked shortcuts utilize Toolbox Pro to analyze the audio and transcribe it. This allows it to embed the audio recording alongside the text transcription in each entry.  </p>\n<p>Itâ€™s a launcher to allow for several smaller prompt paths to be added or removed when the routine needs a shake up.</p>\n<p>Paths to link to from this launcher:<br>\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9410/\">Journal Time - Day Experience Reflection</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9412/\">Journal Time - Random Questions</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9411/\">Journal Time - Day Quality Reflection</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - June 11, 2021, 12:04 a.m.</strong></p>"}
