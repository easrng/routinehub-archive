I have already contacted the DataJar developer about this bug and he should fix it soon. In the meantime, MarketBuddy should work as expected as long as the device has Internet access.</p>\n<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> A temporary fix for this problem is to disable DataJar access to iCloud in the Settings app, but this will also disable DataJar sync with iCloud. You can also disable DataJar's access to cellular data, so that DataJar will run even faster by not having to check Internet connectivity.</p>\n<h5>Features</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Log product prices while buying groceries at the market or at any store you buy regularly;</li>\n<li>See the total price of you grocery list to have no surprises at checkout;</li>\n<li>Be advised when products have already been seen at lower price in other markets;</li>\n<li>See the percentage of increasing or decreasing when price changes;</li>\n<li>See product price changes over time in a chart using Charty app;</li>\n<li>UpdateKit support.</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.4 - June 23, 2020, 3:19 p.m.</strong></p><p>- Solves an issue that may prevent the price history from being saved, because it can be saved wrongly as a List instead of a Dictionary.
