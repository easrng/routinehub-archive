Shortcuts can add themselves to your homescreen with just <strong>two</strong> simple actions. You can download an example <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d170b73d214b4f3cba0e7e7d9d448fcb\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Centre uses an iOS like design to help you feel comfortable. Please note that apps like Settings and Feedback <strong>ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THEIR IOS COUNTERPARTS!</strong> They are there for Centre and have no integration with iOS at all!</p>\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Badges?</h1>\n<p>Of course, the MediaKit gnomes have brought a new badge for use to use! Thanks MediaKit gnomes! You can just add <code>[![Badge](https://dantenl.tk/img/CentreBadge.png)](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8600)</code> and this will be added to your RoutineHub description:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8600\"><img alt=\"Badge\" src=\"https://dantenl.tk/img/CentreBadge.png\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Can I betatest this Shortcut?</h1>\n<p><strong>Yes!</strong> You can download it in the announcements channel in my <a href=\"https://dantenl.tk/discord\">Discord server</a>. To be notified of future betas, go in to the fashion-store channel and assign yourself the Centre Beta Ping role!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.3 - June 21, 2022, 12:50 p.m.</strong></p><p>• Added LiCuts by TheUser<br>• Added Sign in with ∞</p>"}
