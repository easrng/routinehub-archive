It will be updated shortly the official release of these updates. You can try to use it on the betas, but it is not guaranteed to work.</h3>\n\n<p>Using TONS of zero-width spaces, this shortcut can make that happen. This shortcut also includes a thing that fills discord messages with spoilers, like <code>||t||||h||||i||||s||||.||</code> The best thing about the zero-width spaces, is that you can’t see them. Warning: zero-width space insertion may break discord character limits. Don’t try to crash RoutineHub with this. @OIRNOIR is not responsible for any misuse or abuse of this shortcut.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.4 - Sept. 23, 2020, 6:19 a.m.</strong></p><p>iOS 14</p>"}
