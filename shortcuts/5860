The idea is to have your shortcut call this app which will then have the user navigate the shortcuts folder system and once a folder is selected it will return the directory that would need to be entered into the Get File shortcut.</p>\n<p>I had added On My iPhone and the full iCloud Drive folder however I had removed them since you cannot use the directory there to get a file using Get File. In further updates I will be adding them back and when exported it will just give the full url to that file and you can decide what you want to do with that information for yourself.</p>\n<p>I attempted to build this without required folder bookmarks with toolbox pro but have not been able to since Get File does not list folders but will be working on trying to make it as standalone as it can be.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - July 8, 2020, 8:57 p.m.</strong></p><p>Added Embed-a-Update</p>"}
