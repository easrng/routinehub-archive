This is disabled by default.</li>\n<li>(Advanced) If you have a self-hosted OwO instance, you can modify the URLs in the dictionary at the top of the shortcut to point to your own instance instead of the main OwO service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To use OwOcuts, you need to have an OwO account, which can only be obtained at this time by contacting the OwO staff directly to apply for it.
