Have you ever wished you could record them, without them knowing? Well now with Secretly Record, you can! Depending on the legal laws of your area, if you are in a conversation, you may be able to secretly record using this shortcut. \nFor example, some states in the US have something called a one party consent law. In the “one-party consent” law, it is legal to record a phone call or conversation as long at least one party participating in the conversation is aware it is being recorded. Therefore, under federal law, it would be legal in those states as you could consent as being the 1 party. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>How it works:</h3>\n<p>When you tell Siri to open Safari (default app), or any app you choose if you want to customize this shortcut (instructions included) it will register through Siri, your screen will black out for a few seconds, and then you will be in Safari! You won’t hear any recording start, or see it!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Aug. 28, 2021, 6:55 a.m.</strong></p>"}
