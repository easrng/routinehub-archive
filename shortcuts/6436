It’s only very slightly modified for simplicity.</p>\n<p>You can use this to store a shortcut as text, and place that text inside another shortcut. You can use magic variables in that text, which means you can have it change based on user input. I used this method for my shortcut,  <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6338\">Send Later 2.0</a>. </p>\n<p>Once you’ve converted it to text, you’ll need a handful of actions to make it back into a shortcut, and trigger an import of that new shortcut. You can find those here: <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6437\">Generate Shortcut from Text</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Sept. 12, 2020, 9:38 p.m.</strong></p><p>This version adds a “get text from input” action, as suggested by @Saha_. What this means for you is that you no longer have to use the “Paste above” or “Paste Below” action, you can just paste into the empty Text action of Generate Shortcut from Text, and not have any issues. You’ll need to update to version 1.1 of Generate Shortcut from Text, though, or it won’t work.</p>"}
