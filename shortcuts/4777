With such menus, you can give your shortcuts a personal touch and visually optimize the navigation. Many shortcuts have various settings, which the user can adjust according to his or her wishes. For these settings, there is often a choice between \"On\" and \"Off\". iOS Switches provides you with the appropriate graphics for this purpose.</h4>\n<p>This shortcut is mainly intended for shortcut developers. \"iOS Switches\" provides the switch graphics in Base64 format, already resized and prepared for your vCard menu. Start the shortcut, tap a switch of your choice and the graphic will be copied to the clipboard. You can then paste the copied code into your shortcut. That’s it.</p>\n<p><em>Tip: Change the mode by tapping \"Switch to Dark/Light Mode\" to display the respective switches. The colors in Dark Mode are correspondingly darker (and easier on the eyes) and not as bright and vibrant as in Light Mode. To get access to the On/Off Label Switches tap on \"Switch to Label Switches\".</em></p>\n<p><img alt=\"iOS Switches Mockups\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ky13RR4.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h2>Available Switches</h2>\n<p>The ON switches are available in the original iOS colors blue and green. The OFF switch is available in light and dark gray to support shortcuts that use vCard menus with support for Light and Dark Mode. The ON switches are also available in all iOS 13 and iOS 14 Shortcuts colors. A further collection of ten vibrant colors completes the range. All switches are available in shades designed for Light Mode and a more eye-friendly version designed for Dark Mode. All switches are also available in a version with ON/OFF labels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;  </p>\n<h2>Light Mode Default Switches</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n<img alt=\"iOS Switches Light Mode\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EfE4Rym.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;  </p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h2>Dark Mode Default Switches</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n<img alt=\"iOS Switches Dark Mode\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VIuZbRW.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;  </p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h2>Light Mode Label Switches</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n<img alt=\"iOS Label Switches Light\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8pb1JA8.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;  </p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h2>Dark Mode Label Switches</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n<img alt=\"iOS Label Switches Dark\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/isfJDcn.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;  </p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h2>Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>\n<h4>If you have no idea how to integrate a switch into a vCard menu so that it also changes its appearance when a setting is changed, then this shortcut is for you: <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7859ee60b09f4f238c012e8b464343c2\">iOS Switches Simple</a></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7859ee60b09f4f238c012e8b464343c2\"><img alt=\"Simple Example\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nIjVKFf.png\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n<h4>If you want to learn how to add support for Light and Dark Mode, this advanced example is for you: <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/726b2627d8914234b693f8d36ce9992b\">iOS Switches Advanced</a></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/726b2627d8914234b693f8d36ce9992b\"><img alt=\"Advanced Example\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cFH6r5n.png\"></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h2>Credits / License Information</h2>\n<p>The switches graphics included in this shortcut were created with Adobe Illustrator by myself and are subject to copyright.
