This means that the shortcut has a file size of more than 16 MB, which can take up so much memory on your iOS device that your Shortcuts app could crash. It is recommended to make a backup first. Do not use the shortcut as a widget in Today View and never open it in edit mode (cause the shortcut needs even more memory in edit mode/when you try to edit something)! This is even more likely to crash your Shortcuts app/database. Another thing: As you might already know, with the release of iOS 13 you have to scroll through all actions before adding a shortcut. Please be really patient with this shortcut when scrolling, because the huge file size slows down scrolling. Overall it is recommended to use the shortcut only with newer devices. During the adjustment of the shortcut to iOS 13 I had only one database crash. After closing and reopening the app all shortcuts were back. As I said, it's just a question of memory. I have imported and tested the shortcut several times on a test device. The Shortcuts app did not crash once. Use at your own risk!</code></p>\n<h2>Christmas season's starting again. For this reason I have updated the first Advent calendar in the shape of a shortcut for iOS 13. No surprises await all those who already used the calendar last year. Unfortunately I didn't have time to update the content. For all of you who have only discovered the world of shortcuts since December 26, 2018, the Advent calendar may be full of surprises.</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Advent Calendar is 100% Malware Free\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3gZZqIZ.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h3><em>And here's the old description:</em> Ladies and Gentlemen, I proudly present the first and ultimate Advent Calendar in the shape of a Shortcut! Download today and don’t miss any of the 25 surprises waiting for you each day—starting Sunday, December 1st 2019.</h3>\n<h4><em>Note: This Shortcut works between Dec 1st and Dec 25th only.</em></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h3>No internet connection required—this Shortcut works completely offline!</h3>\n<h4>The Advent Calendar shortcut is full of more or less funny and partly interactive elements. It has around 160 actions. <em>This is not a shortcut simply showing you some alert each day. There’s even more…!</em></h4>\n<p><em>But I don’t wanna tell you too much what’s inside, cause it wouldn’t be a surprise anymore. I hope you all have fun with it and I’m wishing you all a festive Christmas season!</em></p>\n<h4>HoHoHo</h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<p><em>PS: Please don’t take this too seriously. And don't expect miracles. I just wanted to create something special for the Christmas Season to put a little smile on your face. You might have seen parts of the calendar before and somewhere else. And there might be things that you don’t like. I’ve tried to make it honest, politically correct, innocent, cordial, funny and hopefully not boring. I’ve had many more unique ideas, but couldn’t implement those due to limitations (database and shortcut crashed many times during experimenting). Some surprises you might already know in a different way or look, but I gave them a Christmas theme/look. I apologize for any inconvenience. ;)</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h4><em>All graphics on this page were made with MediaKit</em></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911\"><img alt=\"Graphics created with MediaKit\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Unqyoq.png\"></a> </p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Exclusively available on RoutineHub.co\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VBSZY2Y.png\"></p>\n<p><em>This Shortcut is available exclusively on RoutineHub.co.
