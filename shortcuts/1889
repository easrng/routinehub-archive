I made a bunch enhancements, changed it to the use Inhaler Usage metric as more appropriate and less-used metric, added iPad check, UpdateKit, etc.</p>\n<p>This shortcut lets you log a cigarette to the Apple Health app and tells you how many you've had so far today.</p>\n<p>It can be run from your Watch or HomePod as well if you configure it as a Siri shortcut.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Apple Health doesn't have a category for cigarettes (or nicotine), so it uses the Inhaler Usage metric. If you need to track actual inhaler usage, this shortcut will mess that up.</p>\n<p>It uses the Health app specifically so that you can view hourly, daily, etc. metrics and graphs as well as manually add or delete entries to keep your data accurate.</p>\n<p>This shortcut incorporates the <em>UpdateKit</em> shortcut so you can receive a notification to download a new version when I make updates to this shortcut.</p>\n<p><em>Keywords: smoking, cigarettes, health, tracking.</em></p>\n<p><em>Supports: UpdateKit.</em></p>\n<p><em>Compatibility: iPhone, Apple Watch, HomePod.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Feb. 9, 2019, 12:22 a.m.</strong></p><p>Lets you configure the emoji or word to use so that it can handle cigarettes, cigars, chew or whatever you want.</p>"}
