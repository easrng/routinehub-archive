With Cook Helper you start with item that has the longest cooking time then add everything else, and the shortcut will do everything else.</p>\n<h6>For example</h6>\n<ul>\n<li>The meat takes <em>85</em> minutes</li>\n<li>The two vegetables dishes take <em>25</em> and <em>12</em> minutes</li>\n<li>Then finally you have <em>3</em> minutes to make a gravy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s not impossible to time a meal like this but with this shortcut there’s no need to do any mental arithmetic.</p>\n<p>The Cheating Chef will set multiple custom alarms, telling you when to start cooking each dish. You will receive a labeled alarm like: <em>”Time to cook the carrots”</em> etc etc. When all the food is done you’ll get a final alarm. <strong>It's time to eat.</strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.5 - Nov. 30, 2018, 6:45 p.m.</strong></p>"}
