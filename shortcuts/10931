This shortcut works for both iOS and macOS, making it versatile enough to fit any schedule. You have the option to join meetings through meeting id/passcode combinations or through a zoom link. You could even automatically leave your meeting on macOS after a certain amount of minutes from entering. Regardless, you could automate this shortcut to join your meetings for you automatically.</p>\n<h1>Configuring the Shortcut</h1>\n<p>You can use only one VacZoom shortcut per meeting schedule because VacZoom will store only enough information to join one meeting. As a result, I recommend renaming it per class or schedule and creating copies for each.</p>\n<p>Once you open the shortcut, commented directions will be present at the top. Below is a dictionary where you will put information about the meeting you want to join in the <strong>value section</strong>.</p>\n<p>The keys and their expected values:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Meeting ID- Meeting id (not needed if you plan to join through URL)</li>\n<li>Passcode- Meeting passcode for the Zoom meeting, but could be left blank if there is no passcode (not needed if you plan to join through URL)</li>\n<li>URL- The URL of the Zoom link (not needed if you plan to join through meeting id/passcode)</li>\n<li>Traditional- This determines if you want to join by meeting id/passcode (<em>true</em>) or through URL (<em>false</em>)</li>\n<li>Time- Set the number of minutes to wait before automatically leaving the meeting (only available on macOS)</li>\n</ul><p></p>\n<h1>Official Website</h1>\n<p>More information about the shortcut can be found on the <a href=\"https://vacwear.com/vaczoom/\">official website</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Jan. 26, 2022, 2:28 a.m.</strong></p>"}
