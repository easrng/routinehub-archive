Works with any shortcut, no special support needed.</p>\n<h1>How to use:</h1>\n<p>When sharing anything to a complex shortcut that is likely to crash (like RoutinePub), instead share your input to AirBag, then select the shortcut you want to run from the menu. This will (mostly) prevent Shortcuts from crashing.</p>\n<p>You only need to use this with the Share Sheet. Running shortcuts by tapping their tile in your library will not crash the app.</p>\n<p>Demo: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/v7cAsPZ\">https://imgur.com/a/v7cAsPZ</a></p>\n<h1>How it works:</h1>\n<p>When sharing to a complex shortcut, like RoutinePub, the Shortcuts app can crash because it is unable to show all the actions on the screen while also running them.</p>\n<p>AirBag avoids this problem by running those shortcuts without showing them on the screen.</p>\n<p>Thanks to heyitzspencer in the RoutineHub Discord for the idea!</p>\n<p><em>To keep things as lightweight as possible, I am not including UpdateKit in AirBag. I don't expect any updates will be necessary, but you may want to check the RoutineHub page every once in a while just in case.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Dec. 6, 2018, 3:11 p.m.</strong></p>"}
