It is similar to San Francisco Compact Rounded, but especially the lowercase o is very different from the font used. Therefore it is unfortunately not possible that the name appears in the correct font face. Instead it appears in the regular San Francisco font face.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Apple and the Apple logo are trademarks of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"Apple Card Preview\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OP5GzsS.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h2>How-to video on Vimeo</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/326549876\"><img alt=\"Apple Card Shortcut Vimeo Promotion Video\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/RW7hxH2.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h2>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h2>\n<p><em>‌Card</em> has an integrated update mechanism called <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/793\">Embed-a-Update</a>.
