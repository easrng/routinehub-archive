Which is a tool that will scrape several manga websites and download any new issues. </p>\n<p>You can find more information on setting this up at the following github repo\nhttps://github.com/Hamuko/cum</p>\n<p>Please note: I did not make or contribute to this github project in any way. It’s just a program I use to grab my new issues. Any questions or issues with this project should be directed to that github page. I have found that this program runs best in Linux. macOS returns errors when running most of the commands through the Shortcut. </p>\n<p>I use this in conjunction with YACReader on the same Linux server. With a port forward from my router and so I can read new issues on my iPhone or iPad from anywhere in the world.</p>\n<p>Supports CryptoKit. So have your cryptokit password ready to paste in the install questions.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Dec. 20, 2018, 3:58 a.m.</strong></p>"}
