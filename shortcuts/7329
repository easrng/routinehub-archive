So if you create a widget from the Folder Grid 1, it will also be called Grid 1 in WidgetPack.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/TRrOdwh.png\"></p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p>In the example that can be seen on the screenshot, I created 3 folders (Grid 1-3) and each contains 6 shortcuts, sorted the shortcuts in it alphabetically and created a widget for each folder. I combined these widgets to a smart stack, so that you can easily scroll through all shortcuts.</p>\n<p><strong>Works with Embed-a-Update</strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - Dec. 18, 2020, 6:58 p.m.</strong></p><p>You can now choose between a light- and darkmode theme when you create a new widget</p>"}
