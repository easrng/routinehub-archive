Details include the app's name, icon, signature, bundle ID, version, and minimal iOS version. You can browse the IPA file from a local file on iPhone and retrieve it directly from the IPA file link.</p>\n<h2>Other </h2>\n<p> Other features, while still unstable, include the ability to create an IPA file from a file with an app extension, and the ability to install an app called GBox that can sign and install any IPA file.</p>\n<img src=\"https://f.easyuploader.app/20210821132859_36466974.png\"><p></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.1 - Aug. 21, 2021, 2 p.m.</strong></p><p>Fixed error</p>"}
