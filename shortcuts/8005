In the previous introduction, it was written that \"AppSync does not work without it\", but you can successfully install signed iPA files without AppSync. The previous version, 6.0, introduced a new installation screen, but it didn't make sense, so I removed it in this version.</p>\n<p></p><p></p>\n<h3>How to use it ?</h3>\n\n<p><b> When you first open it, the Screenkit appears, so press Done to continue. The ipa Library has a link to the ipa file, so you can use that link to install it. install app now can install the app from the link in the ipa file.
