I earn triple points and get Apple gift cards as rewards.</p>\n<p>Until now, I’ve had to screen shot or copy and paste the Gift Card info into a note.</p>\n<p>So I created this shortcut to make life easier. Simply receive your digital Apple Gift Card, and run this shortcut from the share sheet in Safari. It’ll pop up with an Apple Wallet formatted version of the gift card.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.1 - Oct. 23, 2018, 12:44 p.m.</strong></p><p>Optimized shortcut to run almost all functions via javascript, speeding up the entire process. Removed UpdateKit functionality as it required shortcut to resume after 10s to check for updates. I will likely not update this any further for now as it appears to be as optimized as possible.</p>"}
