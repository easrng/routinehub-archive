Enter your favorite pixel size or choose from a list with suggested sizes. Import your image and pixelate it. That’s it!

Select Pixel Size</h4>\n<p>A list with a bunch of predefined pixel sizes appears—choose your favorite.</p>\n<h4>2. Enter Pixel Size</h4>\n<p>If you want to enter your own size, this is the place to enter it.</p>\n<h4>3. Pixelate Reference</h4>\n<p>Have a look at all predefined pixel sizes from the list and see the results (based on an image with 1000 x 1000 pixels).</p>\n<h4>4. Scale Source Image</h4>\n<p>The smaller the pixel size the longer the time you’ll have to wait for results. Same with the source image: The bigger it is the longer the wait. Please reduce the size of your source image if it takes to long pixelating it. Recommended size: up to 1500 pixels. Of course it also works fast with larger files if you choose big pixels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h3>Pixelate How To:</h3>\n<p>Choose or enter your preferred pixel size or resize the image (it will be automatically saved to your Photos) you want to pixelate.  </p>\n<p>Next a window appears where you will be prompted to choose the source image by hitting the <em>Choose Image</em> button (sources: <em>Camera Roll, iCloud Drive</em> or simply <em>take a photo)</em>.  </p>\n<p>Wait until the image gets pixelated. If you don’t like the result, you can upload another image. If you want to try it with another pixel size, you have to restart <em>Pixelate</em> (see <em>Pixelate Reference</em> for reference results).  </p>\n<p>If you want to save your pixelated image, tap the <em>Save Image</em> button. The image will show up in another window. Simply hold your finger on that image and you’ll have the option to save it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h3>Light &amp; Dark Mode Support:</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Pixelate Screenshots 1/2\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/j4wEWpj.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"Pixelate Screenshots 2/2\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yp8zlfg.png\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h2>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h2>\n<p><em>Pixelate</em> has an integrated update mechanism called <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/793\">Embed-a-Update</a>.
