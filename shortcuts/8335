Thanks for your interest in this shortcut, which will automatically set your alarms depending on the events listed in your calendars.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"alt text\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EQDCNS0.png\" title=\"Contextual Alarm\"></p>\n<h3>How to use</h3>\n<p>There are two ways in which you can use Contextual Alarm, as it has two components: Dynamic Times and Static Times.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Dynamic Times set alarms at X minutes before the start of any event. This is completely dynamic and does not require you to specify the time of any event.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Static Times can be used in case you want to deviate from the dynamic times for specific events. These override the dynamic times. You specify both the time of the event and the time at which you want your alarms to be set.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can use either one of these methods to automatically set your alarms, or combine both components.</p>\n<h5>Configure dynamicTimes:</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Add new item &gt; text</li>\n<li>Enter any value for the key. Doesn't matter what it is, as long as the value is not the same as a previous key (eg. use a, b, c, so on)</li>\n<li>Enter the amount of minutes for the text</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You may add as many alarms as you like.</p>\n<h5>Configure staticTimes:</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Add new item &gt; array</li>\n<li>Key: enter value for start time of event (eg. 09:00)</li>\n<li>0 items &gt; add new item &gt; text</li>\n<li>Text: enter specific time you want the alarm to be set (eg. 07:30)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Automate the shortcut</h3>\n<p>Contextual Alarm is designed to be run in the evenings, seamlessly and without interaction.
