For images, it will launch the markup tool and copy the results back to your clipboard/desktop. For links, it will open them in Safari. </p>\n<p>Known limitations: Universal copy and paste from MacOS finder to iOS doesn't pass the correct objects, only the icons. Therefore this shortcut only works with images/links copied from the web.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Oct. 12, 2018, 8:50 p.m.</strong></p>"}
