It will play whole tracks (if you are logged on, and have Apple Music), </p>\n<p>I don't have an Apple Music subscription, I don't really feel the need to play with it. If it works for anyone else, or they want to use the idea,  please go ahead.

Add a get file action as well App Store/Photos, and you can keep a pack of similarly colored icons at hand for choosing in icloud rather than clogging up the photos app.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>.11 - Nov. 28, 2018, 10:55 p.m.</strong></p><p>Added warnings</p>"}
