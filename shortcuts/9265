I have automated all this down to just two clicks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on the Meeter in the menu bar</li>\n<li>Click on 'Join Zoom Call' button</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To have this button available, I use Meeter app in the menu bar (the strip on the top of the screen).</p>\n<p>You can download the Meeter app for free using the Mac App Store link from their official site, but with in-app purchases.</p>\n<p>With the free version you will have to click 'Allow' in your default browser instead of directly opening the Zoom app.</p>\n<p>If you think the pro version is worth it, you can actually get it for free if you have a SetApp subscription.</p>\n<p>I recently discovered they have an iOS app too. You can use it to join meetings from your iPhone.</p>\n<p>SetApp is a subscription service that offers a collection of very expensive apps for a fraction of their price, legally. The business model is similar to Netflix. You can say SetApp is the Netflix of apps. I enjoy it so much, I have even published an article about all my favourite 'quality of life improvements'. You can install SetApp to try 210+ apps for a week. I recommend signing up with my referral link to get 1 month free. That will grant you proper time to explore each app before you can decide whether you want to commit to a subscription or not.</p>\n<p>https://go.setapp.com/invite/devansh4?s=l</p>\n<p>Blog post at: https://dvnsh.com/how-i-join-zoom-meetings-effortlessly</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1 - May 29, 2021, 12:09 a.m.</strong></p>"}
