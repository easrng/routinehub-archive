This enables the shortcut to run much more smoothly and efficiently by passing off large chunks of actions off to smaller shortcuts instead!<br>-Support for iOS/iPadOS 15, macOS 12, and watchOS 8!<br>-Front and Center! No more scrolling to find stuff! Key actions are located in the main menu of the shortcut! Other smaller things like finding locations can be found under Resources.<br>-QR Scanning! Ever see those QR Screens during the experiences? Now you can scan them in-shortcut! Just tap Resources, then tap QR Scanner, and boom! Done!<br><br>Fixed:<br>-Removes a TON of broken links and makes navigating the shortcut a lot easier.</p>"}
