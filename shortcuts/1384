So far, the available icon sets include Material Design and Font Awesome. Once you have saved these sets, you can browse them and save or convert the icons you’d like to use.</p>\n<hr>\n<h5>Features:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Save icons to files</li>\n<li>Save icons to photos</li>\n<li>Copy icons</li>\n<li>Copy Base64 for icons</li>\n<li>Convert icons</li>\n<li>Works offline (after icon sets are added)</li>\n<li>Modular (download as many icon sets as you’d like)</li>\n<li>Check for Updates support</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h5>Integrate Iconify into your shortcuts:</h5>\n<p>As of version 1.1, Iconify now includes an \"external\" function that other shortcuts can call upon to use within their own shortcut. Using it is as simple as passing a dictionary with the key value pair of \"function\":\"external\" to it via the Run Shortcut action, similar to integrating with UpdateKit. Iconify will pass back the base64 of the chosen icon, or if there was no chosen icon, Iconify will pass back nothing.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/793\" title=\"Get Check For Updates\"><img alt=\"This Shortcut Supports Check For Updates\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fHsBvXr.png\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>made by <a href=\"/user/heyitzspencer\">@heyitzspencer</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - Dec. 30, 2018, 8:31 p.m.</strong></p><p>-Shortcut keeps running after an action is taken now</p>"}
