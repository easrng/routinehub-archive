With Toggler, you can create and edit toggles to fit your needs. Toggler is easy-to-use and each toggle contains all the following switches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cellular Data</li>\n<li>Wi-Fi</li>\n<li>Bluetooth</li>\n<li>Airplane Mode</li>\n<li>DND</li>\n<li>Low Power Mode</li>\n<li>Play Music</li>\n<li>Appearance</li>\n<li>Orientation Lock</li>\n<li>Volume</li>\n<li>Brightness</li>\n<li>Flashlight</li>\n<li>AssistiveTouch</li>\n<li>Audio Descriptions</li>\n<li>Classic Invert</li>\n<li>Close Captions+SDH</li>\n<li>Smart Invert</li>\n<li>Reduce Motion</li>\n<li>Reduce Transparency</li>\n<li>Mono Audio</li>\n<li>LED Flash</li>\n<li>Increase Contrast</li>\n<li>Start Guided Access</li>\n<li>Zoom</li>\n<li>VoiceOver</li>\n<li>White Point</li>\n<li>Voice Control</li>\n<li>Switch Control</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may be thinking to yourself \"just another useless control center shortcut\", but no, this is not one of those. Once you have created toggles, they can speed up tasks that otherwise takes 13 clicks with as little as one click. You can even run toggles on automation or in other shortcuts easily with just 3 actions.</p>\n<p>Explore the shortcut yourself to find out more!</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Feedback</h4>\n<p>If you have any suggestions, found any bugs, or need some help, just comment below</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.1.0 - June 17, 2021, 11:19 a.m.</strong></p><p>- New orientation lock switch.<br>- Added a \"Toggle Menu\" option on the main editing menu to return to the menu in which you can run, edit, share, or delete the toggle.<br>- Shortened the code by running with input.
