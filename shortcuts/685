While this shortcut does not let you directly edit the current AM queue (not currently possible with Shortcuts), it can start playing a playlist with the ability to choose your sorting method (Default, descending, song title, artist, date added), let you select songs in the new queue you want to remove from it, and let you choose songs you want to move to the top of the queue.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Nov. 1, 2018, 11:04 p.m.</strong></p>"}
