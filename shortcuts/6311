Any additional features will be part of its smarter sibling, <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6552/\">Text to PNG</a>.</em></p>\n<h3>Original description</h3>\n<p>Sometimes I've needed a <strong>flat-color image</strong> as a background, or to overlay on top of another image. After checking the documentation, it turns out that doing it with JavaScript is astonishingly easy, even if I need transparency.</p>\n<p>I've had this shortcut for a while, but a recent conversation reminded me of it and I decided to publish it in case someone finds it useful.</p>\n<p>When run the shortcut gives the user the option to change three parameters, width, height and color. With these and a bit of JavaScript a PNG is generated, and the user is given the option of renaming and saving it.</p>\n<p>The \"color\" parameter can have any <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/color\">valid CSS color value</a>. Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>red</li>\n<li>#0F0</li>\n<li>#FF00FF</li>\n<li>rgb(255, 0, 255)</li>\n<li>#FF7F007F</li>\n<li>rgba(255, 127, 0, 0.5)</li>\n<li>transparent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The shortcut has only eight actions, of which four are responsible of generating the image. It could be done with just three sacrificing legibility.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.2 - Sept. 21, 2020, 4:18 p.m.</strong></p><p>Compatible with iOS 12 via ScPL (also, old brush icon!)</p>"}
