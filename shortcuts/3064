Your choice! </li>\n<li>From Afternoon onwards it does not check Routinehub allowing you to enjoy using the main shortcut so it does not slowdown the shortcut from operation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What’s the Difference</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Many other Updaters have 300+ actions some have over 500!</li>\n<li>300+ actions takes 30x longer to run than 23 actions in Demon Updater</li>\n<li>Therefore your main shortcut takes longer to load</li>\n<li>if you Main Shortcut has 100 actions why do you need an updater with 500 actions???</li>\n<li>with Demon Updater the Update part is built into the main shortcut so there are no errors or menus to click in Demon Updater.</li>\n<li>With Demon Updater “You control” when you Update NOT the Updater</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uHWWs6p.jpg\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>iOS 13 demands a different way to create an updater so there are some changes inside bring it up to 23 actions for iOS 13 but has had an effect on speed “it’s now fast than the iOS 12 version.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Three steps shown below</h2>\n<h2>Place this Dictionary at the top of your main shortcut</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6uDu7fw.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>place this in your main shortcut somewhere after the dictionary</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YnWcFb4.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>place the Update variable in your main menu</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jYCnFiR.jpg\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p>You can download How To Series : Build In Demon Updater\nTo show you how it works and Run Speed Tests for Confirmation that you now have RoutineHubs fasted Updater</p>\n<h1>Demon Updater</h1>\n<h3>credit to @AShortcuts for the use of his Test Speed shortcut.</h3>\n<h1>Active (checking RoutineHub)</h1>\n<hr>\n<h1>None Active (not Checking RoutineHub)</h1>\n<hr>\n<h2>This Not just another Updater it has been tried and tested for the last Five Months, based on Control Centre Update with over 2000 downloads here on RoutineHub</h2>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>3.0 - July 14, 2019, 5:20 p.m.</strong></p><p>Corrected a messaging issue now works as expected</p>"}
