This Shortcut allows your iOS 14 device to receive a handoff from your iOS 15 device — great for anyone with one device on the iOS/iPadOS 15 beta and another on iOS 14.</p>\n<p>TIP: to send your music from an iOS device on iOS 14 to one on iOS 15, you can screenshot your queue on your iOS 14 device, and then wait for iCloud Photo Library to sync or AirDrop the photo(s) to your iOS 15 device. From there you can grab the text and run Handoff Music from the Share Sheet, and then run it directly, and your queue will be transferred.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - July 16, 2021, 9:26 p.m.</strong></p><p>This version updates to add features found in Handoff Music 0.2.
