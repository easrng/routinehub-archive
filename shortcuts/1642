This is the best way to share wide images for seamless viewing and uploading. Accepts both share sheet and shortcuts input. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Sample Post\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YoXnZQo.mp4\"></p>\n<p>If you image cannot be trimmed into exact squares, you will be prompted to crop your image first. The size is chosen automatically, and you can choose whether the cropped image will be taken from the centre, left or right of the original image.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Crop process\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/C4eBlVl.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Once you've cropped, you'll be prompted to save your images to the camera roll, save them to your files, or share them with the traditional share sheet. You can use this method to send the output images to your contacts by iMessage, for example.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Share process\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sZ7HR48.jpg\"></p>\n<p>The result is a beautiful, high resolution series of perfectly square images. Give it a try with your own panoramas!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Sample\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/syIDdtt.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Of course, this shortcut is designed for use with Instagram, but isn't necessary.</p>\n<p>This shortcut uses UpdateKit to ensure you always have the latest version.
