No extra apps required.</strong></p>\n<p>This should work on ALL videos, including music videos, since it is just using YouTube's native player.</p>\n<p>Simply open the video in Safari, tap to unmute it, and then run the shortcut from the share sheet. The video should automatically enter PIP mode in a few seconds. (If it doesn't, try going back to the home screen or running the shortcut again).</p>\n<p>Once this shortcut is enabled on a tab, PIP will continue working even if you navigate to another video, as long as you don't reload the tab.</p>\n<p>Note: This shortcut must be run from Safari. If you run it from the YouTube app, you will be automatically redirected to Safari.</p>\n<hr>\n<h5>Privacy notice</h5>\n<p>When you run this shortcut directly from the Shortcuts app, your home screen or a widget (rather than from the share sheet), it reads your clipboard to check if it contains a YouTube link. This information is never sent anywhere, you can check the shortcut's code yourself to confirm this.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.3.0 - Nov. 30, 2020, 2:09 p.m.</strong></p><p>- Added support for reading YouTube URL from clipboard<br>- Notification is shown instead of alert when not running from Safari</p>"}
