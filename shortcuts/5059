Everything is working via the Agenda's x-callback-url.</p>\n<p>if you want to customise the shortcut, you can find the X-callback-url Support and Reference of the Agenda application here: <a href=\"https://agenda.community/t/x-callback-url-support-and-reference/27253\">Agenda x-callback-url</a></p>\n<p>Project Title and the Note Title that you input in setup process should also be created in the app --&gt; Agenda, or you can input titles that are already in use. I use \"Quick Note\" for the Project Title and \"Note - Time*\" for the Note Title.</p>\n<h6>I M P O R T A N T</h6>\n<p>*After setup is complete you should go in \"My Shortcuts\" tab --&gt; Tap on the 3 dots on the upper right corner of the shortcut, and then add the variable \"Time\" next to the Note Title. This is crucial so your next quick note has not the same title as the one before.</p>\n<p>As always if you have any suggestions please leave a feedback.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.5 - June 12, 2020, 5:55 p.m.</strong></p><p>Integrated QuickUpdate.<br>Now you don't have to download an additional shortcut for the updates.</p>"}
