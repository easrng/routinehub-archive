I decided to make a shortcut with it, and it was relatively easy to do. It may serve as an example to learn Shortcuts, so I have added comments in the non-trivial steps.</p>\n<p>That website stopped working in May 29th, so in version 1.2.0 I switched to <code>instaview.me</code>, a similar site.</p>\n<p>First published at <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/eekc6t/download_instagram_story/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/eekc6t/download_instagram_story/</a> (Dec'19).</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2.0 - May 30, 2020, 11:15 a.m.</strong></p><p>Switched to instaview.me because the original website doesn't seem to work anymore</p>"}
