Blood donations help save lives, and a very small number of people donate when they are able to. </p>\n<p>Using public information on the <a href=\"https://redcrossblood.org/\">American National Red Cross website</a>, this Shortcut aims to make it easier to sign up to donate, remember to donate, and find out basics about donations through Shortcuts! It is important to note that this Shortcut is <b>not</b> endorsed in any way shape or form by the American National Red Cross and it's important to always check the information provided online and by Red Cross personnel. </p>\n<h2>What can you do?</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Schedule a donation through the online platform with your Zip Code and a choice of the type of donation you want to make. </li>\n<li>Create a Calendar Event of an upcoming donation. </li>\n<li>Create a Calendar Event to remind you when to donate again!
