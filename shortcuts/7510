This calculation will tell you, and allow you to set the resulting g/L as your preferred ratio.</p>\n<p><strong>g/L Setting</strong>: Change your preferred ratio. Initially set at 60 g/L.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: via UpdateKit</p>\n<p><em>Bean Calc relies on iCloud for storing your preferred ratio and previous input for default values. It also will request to run itself after changing a setting.</em></p>\n<hr>\n\n<h4>Call Bean Calc Functions Directly</h4>\n<p><img alt=\"Call Bean Calc with input variable\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Z83zPf0.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>As of V1.1.0</strong>, you can call these functions directly from your own shortcuts or automations by passing one of the following strings: Get Volume, Get Dose, Get Ratio, Set Ratio, or Update.</p>\n<hr>\n\n<h4>Roadmap and Known Issues</h4>\n<p>As of 2/4/2020: I plan to add profiles for multiple recipe variations, as well as the ability to pass these profiles as arguments from your own shortcuts, eg French Press, Pour Over Light Roast, etc.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I'm working on adding a final volume calculator, so instead of a general input volume, you would receive an input volume based on dissolved solids, retention ratio, dose, and desired final volume of coffee. This would definitely need to be stored as a profile.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - Jan. 26, 2021, 2:36 p.m.</strong></p><p>This version fixes precision loss from rounding.
