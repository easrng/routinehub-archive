It might take a few more seconds than before but it’s due to the more lines of code to get around YouTube’s protection. <br><br>Also you will need to signup on www.rapidapi.com and get a FREE API KEY to download the protected videos/music. <br><br>You will be prompted to set that api key up upon first run and you will never be bothered with it again. <br><br>Another thing I forgot to mention is you can listen to all your downloaded songs from within this shortcut or you can open them up in VLC from within this shortcut if you have the app installed. <br><br>Enjoy!!!</p>"}
