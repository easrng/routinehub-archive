Note: It doesn’t work with half hour, you need to add it manually. However, you can add 9:30 - 11:00 to the note, for example, but half an hour will not be counted and will be rounded to the nearest hour. So if you have a time of 9:30 - 11:00 the abbreviation will calculate it as 2 hours. The list you see in this shortcut will just add month name in note.</p>\n<p>————————————————————————————</p>\n<p>Important: Don’t move notes to folders like (1) January that created “Work Time Log” if you don’t finish a month of work!
