In that case, you can either replace those actions with the Toolbox Pro equivalent, or try using the \"Partial block\" method, but that one only hides the notifications from the lock screen, so you will have to enable Do Not Disturb to hide the banners.</p>\n<p><strong>This does not block banners from home screen shortcuts!</strong> Combine this with the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/V3WDJW3AQog\">automation trick</a> for that (this only replaces the screen time step).</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.1.0 - Feb. 7, 2021, 4:06 p.m.</strong></p>"}
