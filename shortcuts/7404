This <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/1c51b16f68ef457e92eaf7d7f4dfcc19\">simple shortcut</a> demonstrates the poor performance.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I've used the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/\">Apple Feedback Assistant</a> to report both as bugs even though I suspect that #1 is a design change that Apple is unlikely to reverse. <strong>Please consider making a similar report if you concur that these iOS 14 changes have been a step backwards.</strong></p>\n<p>I've created the actions in this shortcut, and two others, to help circumvent the <strong>Choose from List</strong> shortcomings.
