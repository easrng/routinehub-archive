He didn’t think it was possible.  Guess now you can leave him a message about this shortcut, since it was his brain. </p>\n<p>HOW IT WORKS\nThe concept here is to have the least amount of user interaction in a shortcut.<br>\nTHE FIRST WORD is the language you want to translate TO.\nThe rest is the message.<br>\nIt captures the first word, sets as a language settings, then adds the remaining dictation into a message to pass through the translator.\nThen it copies to clipboard and all you have to do is paste.</p>\n<p>Language\n—————-\nThe default language is set to English.\nIf you want to translate FROM another language set it here.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Dec. 14, 2020, 7:58 a.m.</strong></p>"}
