{"id":"5189","name":"Send Audio to App","tagline":"This shortcut extracts audio from audio and video files, and sends it directly to the apps listed.","icon":"ios14 c2071128575 g59708","latest":"26528","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Remember how you could use “Open in...” for a ton of apps but iOS 13 changed some of the ways the apps interact? This shortcut allows you to automatically send an audio file (or the audio from a video file) directly into an app. </p>\n<p>The apps can be modified to suit your preferences. You don’t  need all the apps listed. These were the ones I tested and found to work.</p>\n<p>(As of this post, the “other” option doesn’t work. Will possibly update it, but I left it as a placeholder for further updates)</p>\n<p>How to use the shortcut:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Find an audio file or video file containing audio.</li>\n<li>Tap on the share option (depending on the app you’re using, you may need to press and hold the file, or find the share icon).</li>\n<li>Share the file to the shortcut named, “Send Audio to App”.</li>\n<li>Wait for app list to appear. If the list doesn’t show, try again.</li>\n<li>Select the app.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As with all shortcuts, make sure to add unauthorized shortcut when downloading for the first time.</p>\n<p>Example of use cases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Send to Brusfri to instantly clean the audio.</li>\n<li>Send to djay to get the key and bpm of a song.</li>\n<li>Send to Nanostudio 2 to allow audio stems, loops, and samples in Nanostudio via Slate (drum pad)  - Add a slate instrument/Go to the Slate drum pad/ Tap on the sample menu above/Drag sample into an empty drum pad.</li>\n<li>Send to Audiostretch to allow pitching audio stems.</li>\n<li>Send to Reslice for instant sampling.</li>\n<li>Send recorded audio from Oval Synth immediately into Reslice/Audioshare.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can also customize the apps based on which ones you have/don’t have. See the apps listed to the left for iOS apps supported on the latest version.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.11 - April 2, 2021, 12:09 a.m.</strong></p><p>Added an auto updater.<br>Also, added Voice Record Pro, and Spire (from Isotope)</p>"}
