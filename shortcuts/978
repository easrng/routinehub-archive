When starting the shortcut directly from within the <em>Shortcuts</em> app or the <em>Today View</em>, your clipboard content will be automatically loaded into <strong>Read with Speed™</strong>.</p>\n<p>Next the shortcut opens a new window, where you can start speed reading. Simply tap the <em>READ</em> button to start. Hit it again to <em>PAUSE</em> reading. A slider is used to give you the possibility to change the reading position.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Read with Speed™\" src=\"https://oztfxw.dm.files.1drv.com/y4moT3ECb-DX6HJib3BVrIOsuunkZkumZHP7wBGfX1hjySEKSMNpbOdLiFVcpwLrDcH4M1e1L086dbJAeJtm-ExNwtjcO7Lzn0zONXbKKtO2-aS9brjBECWp5D2mdH3VH8eQ_i9Ykjn1eBJXfaXBD0FGWqTSOOAzaFiKBx0IdFAfXEb084lUuyVJJT_8VykBM5BqM4VeSg5I__YLYpwT1Nryw/20181231_013340526_iOS.jpg\"></p>\n<p>The default <em>Words Per Minute (WPM)</em> is 200, but you can adjust it as you like with a slider. The shortcut will remember these settings. That said, even if you quit the <em>Shortcuts App</em> your <em>WPM</em> settings will remain if you use <strong>Read with Speed™</strong> again.</p>\n<p>By default words with less than four characters will merge and display together to improve the reading speed.</p>\n<p>The whole design is responsive and will display great starting with iPhone 5/SE. </p>\n<p>The default font size is 32px, but you can change this to your needs with a dedicated slider. This setting will be saved as well, so you don’t need to change it each time you use the shortcut.</p>\n<p>There’s even a <em>Dark Mode</em> toggle, if you like it white on black!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Read with Speed™\" src=\"https://ozveug.dm.files.1drv.com/y4mZeXedUqWa8Iz8FMS2QnovVUFIUC9t9uUM1dNN_f32Ug1cxJ577XX20H1uz0croclKPhYqXs4TMLbxbYT1FDofh9apvAkKJnSnSKsAuIMOIhmP3gsSCIHlCYufIE2DbUMXkrbHJOrCSAx80TpuXKwWLF7QrlFy3NQEhRv4tqfjRXZYLsoconUVFGIfj8RoQzce30mi5e2mt7L6QKR6Td4Tg/20181231_013407249_iOS.jpg\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;  </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Exclusively available on RoutineHub.co\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VBSZY2Y.png\"></p>\n<p><em>This Shortcut is available exclusively on RoutineHub.co.
