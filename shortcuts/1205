It will allow you to choose the duration of your Pomodoro, your short break and your long break, as well as how many full cycles you would like to run.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn addition you can choose a Reminder from iPhone Reminders to focus on in each Pomodoro. If you choose a Reminder, after the Pomodoro it will ask you if you completed it or not. Upon completion it will duplicate the Reminder and set a \"Completed\" after the name. Unfortunately Shortcuts doesn't allow you to Complete the reminders (meaning, checking the check-box).\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter choosing your time settings, the Shortcut will start your timer and notify you when you need to take a break and for how long.\n</p>\n\n<h4>In Action:</h4>\n\n<p><img alt=\"in action\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/YAXAOwxy0bbyzUUKB3/giphy.gif\" title=\"In Action\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.01 - Dec. 11, 2018, 5:19 p.m.</strong></p>"}
