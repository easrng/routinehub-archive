Pretty simple concept.</p>\n<p>If you want to make shortcuts for Jarvis, email me at jarvis.shortcut@gmail.com and your shortcut can be part of the all-in-one Jarvis.

If you activate this shortcut directly, the text it displays after Jarvis speaks will not be shown unless you’re running this shortcut from Jarvis 1.0.2 or later. If you run it directly, it won’t show the text. This is a workaround so Siri doesn’t speak the text it’s just meant to show when Jarvis finishes speaking.</p>"}
