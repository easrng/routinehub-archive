Titin is important in the contraction of striated muscle tissues. It connects the Z line to the M line in the sarcomere. The protein contributes to force transmission at the Z line and resting tension in the I band region.[10] It limits the range of motion of the sarcomere in tension, thus contributing to the passive stiffness of muscle. Variations in the sequence of titin between different types of muscle (e.g., cardiac or skeletal) have been correlated with differences in the mechanical properties of these muscles.[5][11]</p>\n<p>(Source: Wikipedia)</p>\n<p>It is also the longest word, at 189,819 letters. This shortcut will make Siri say the name.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Feb. 17, 2021, 2:20 a.m.</strong></p>"}
