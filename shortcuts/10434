The result is formatted as an association list shown in a dialog and is copied to <em>Universal Clipboard</em> making it accessible on any Apple device on your network. This shortcut works only with another shortcut of my authorship, \"Make Association List\" prompted to download if not found in your shortcuts library. You may choose to use the example text (a well-known excerpt from the novel <em>A Tale Of Two Cities</em> by Ch. Dickens) to see it in action or enter your text straight away.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>. Special characters are ignored by the shortcut. If you wish the shortcut to honour those, please, comment below.</p>\n<p><strong>Note 2</strong>. <em>The shortcut may generate non-sensical results with some types of input data such as a list of unique items that are supposed to be constituent parts but not the items themselves. It usually happens when, for example, formatted dates become text objects via the</em> <strong>Formate date</strong> <em>action as opposed to preserving their type as a standard date object and thus unintentionally are subject to text splitting which normally is meant only for text but not a date. E.g., the date</em> <strong>2021-07-15, 18:30:00</strong> <em>breaks down into</em> <strong>{2021, 07, 15, 18, 30, 00}</strong>. <em>There's no way to work around this inconsistency unless tailoring this plugin on a case-by-case basis. Still, it will make its best to attempt to circumvent this annoyance.</em></p>\n<p>Feedback is welcome.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - Nov. 30, 2021, 9:43 a.m.</strong></p><p>Added a loop to circumvent a false negative while checking the Shortcuts library for the existence of the \"Make Association List\" shortcut.</p>"}
