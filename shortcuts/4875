The goal was not to create a version of a copyright infringement, but to create an - if possible faster or more convenient -alternative visit option for <a href=\"https://routinehub.co\"><em>routinehub.co</em></a> .</p>\n<p>One of the main problems here was the <strong><em>speed</em></strong>. Because you can make a \"get .. from .. HTML\" version, but the <em>resulting data consumption is relatively nogo</em>.</p>\n<p>So the idea was to create a <strong><em>\"local storage\"</em></strong> based variant. While experimenting with <em>vCard</em> markdown as a load and save option, I found out how quickly Siri Shortcuts reach their limits. Fantastically, working with .vcf files is like clockwork. 4000 files - no problem. The database is therefore based on <a href=\"https://Archiv.zip\"><em>Archiv.zip</em></a> and must be downloaded at the beginning. (38.5 MB)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>saved into</em> <strong><em>Shortcuts/RHFeedDB/Merge/</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Once downloaded</strong>, each time the shortcut is started, the last element is loaded from both the .zip and the website and their IDs are compared.</p>\n<p>If there <strong>is a difference</strong>, <em>ONLY the missing shortcuts are reloaded and added to the archive</em>.</p>\n<p>If there is <strong>no difference</strong>, <em>the main menu loads and you can choose between the following functions</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Search</strong> (search the database = 3427 shortcuts (at the moment))</li>\n<li><strong>Feed</strong> (obviously)</li>\n<li><strong>Recently Updated Shortcuts</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Trending shortcuts</strong></li>\n<li><strong>RemindHub</strong> (just a \"save-for-later list\")</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>One more thing about the*<em> </em></strong>Archiv.zip<strong><em> </em>*file - the database</strong></p>\n<p>The profile picture of my account on <a href=\"https://routinehub.co\">routinehub.co</a> is a <strong>QR code</strong> - which is captured and decrypted by the shortcut. The <strong>decoded content is the download link to the .zip file.</strong></p>\n<p>As far as I can, I always create an <strong>up-to-date QR code of the latest Archive*<em> and <strong>replace the profile picture on my account</strong>. This <strong>ensures that the latest version</strong> can always be loaded </em></strong>without having to update the shortcut every time***.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it is just a fun shortcut and was a project I wanted to achieve and I am proud to have done it. Maybe it is used or even optimized by one or the other, the right to use is granted to everyone.</p>\n<p>Thanks and good night,</p>\n<p>GrotRec Shortcuts</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p>​</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.8 - April 16, 2020, 6:44 p.m.</strong></p><p>Bug fixes</p>"}
