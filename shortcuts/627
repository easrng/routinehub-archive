Future updates may add more functions through it.  It can now be installed directly from Preferences in the shortcut!</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>\n<p>You must <em>enable remote login</em> on your Mac to use this. For some functions, an admin login is required. </p>\n<p>Mac Maestro takes a different approach than other SSH shortcuts it is based on or borrows from: First, a focus on how it can usefully control your Mac remotely more than as an SSH utility as such. I've added all the features I think would be useful and functional for a little utility of this sort, and I am open to suggestions about more.</p>\n<p>Second, it takes a different approach to security. We take the view that sensitive login credentials are better stored locally behind a PIN/Touch/Face ID than saved in the cloud where scripts that can update themselves can access. Of course, each approach is insecure in different ways. For that reason, Mac Maestro saves Preferences manually, and loads them automatically. But it doesn't save login credentials outside the shortcut. Update checking is requested only manually.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p>\n<p>Mac Maestro is a fork of the excellent <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/9q5xnp/ssh_manager_smart/\">SSH Manager</a> by u/xMrVizzy. I've forked it with his consent, and its now a very different beast.  <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/476\">SSH Tools</a>, which itself was forked from SSH Manager, had some other useful ideas. Which apparently are being, ah, cross-pollenated now.</p>\n<p>Thanks for development assistance from various people on reddit, in particular u/passwd123456 for <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/9sgr14/how_to_avoid_popups_when_run_script_over_ssh_has/\">ideas about error trapping</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.4 - Nov. 11, 2018, 9:41 p.m.</strong></p><p>• Added (iTunes) \"Skip to Next Album\" feature via mmhelper (update mmhelper required)<br>•&nbsp;Display Sleep, System Sleep<br>• Wake on LAN (via Open App…; Recommended: Mocha WOL *)<br>• fixed quoting issue with Transfer Clipboard&gt;Send to Mac<br>• added option to specify different external SSH port (optional)<br>•&nbsp;no preferences reset required from version 1.2+ :)<br>* Mocha WOL is free!
