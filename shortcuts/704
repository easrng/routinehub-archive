You can clear your clipboard, copy to your clipboard, check what’s on your clipboard and even see your clipboard history &amp; recall from it. I created this for anyone but it’s a great tool for developers. I’ve been using it for several weeks now while developing other Shortcuts and decided to share it with you. Enjoy!!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.1 - Jan. 14, 2019, 6:02 a.m.</strong></p><p>Cleaned up the code so it now runs a lot quicker and smoother.
