Sorry it takes forever to run. It has to loop through 400+ timezones looking for country and timezone names. It’s inefficent but it gets the job done.</p>\n<p>Please note that the time conversion API I use is rate limited to one request per second, so on the off chance you try to do something at the same time one else does, you may get a failed conversion/country/zone lookup. I didn’t build error handling because this seems unlikely.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Nov. 27, 2018, 5:43 a.m.</strong></p>"}
