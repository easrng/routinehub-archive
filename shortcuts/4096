Though the shortcut starts as a small soundboard, I'll also add more sound to it. from sound affects like and his name is John Cena, bruh, and all the other good sound effects, this will be fun for y'all.\nYou also get the roblox death sound! you also get sounds like look at this dude.\nSo, what are y'all waiting for? Download it and see how cool it really is. Also, one of the sound effects called my name is Jeff won't play for some reason. It's been decoded to base64 and the play sound action is there. Well, enjoy anyway. If you have sound suggestions or issues, write them down in the comments. You can also suggest sounds to be added.\nWorning, all sound effects go to the respectful owners. Most of them are non-copyrighted anyway.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.4 - Nov. 19, 2020, 10:22 p.m.</strong></p><p>New sound - Damn son where'd you find this.
