Add <code>,radius=N</code> to the image name to use a radius of <code>N</code> pixels (up to 255). The shortcut can process images with alpha channel (transparency) without bleeding issues.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Example of image blurring\" src=\"https://atnbueno.com/blur-image.png\"></p>\n<p>I've simplified the <a href=\"https://github.com/Quasimondo/QuasimondoJS/blob/master/blur/StackBlur.js\">original StackBlur code</a> down to less than 4 KB, and the extra code to use it is barely larger than some URLs.</p>\n<p>When run without input, the shortcut works as a demo, allowing the user to select one or more files and showing the result of the conversion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No error checking</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/getImageData\"><code>getImageData</code> documentation at MDN</a></li>\n<li>\"Get File of Type\" is used instead of \"Get Contents of Webpage\" to avoid that the user is misleading told that the shortcut uses Safari</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.0 - Nov. 21, 2021, 7:26 p.m.</strong></p>"}
