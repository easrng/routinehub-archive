They've each taught me how important it is to log my symptoms. Doing it in a .csv format is the compatibility icing on the cake  Although <strong>ebb period tracker</strong> doesn't predict menstrual cycles, my sister shortcut, <strong>ebb for Health</strong>, allows for tracking and predicting through the iOS Health app. Otherwise, use <strong>ebb period tracker</strong> <em>alongside your current menstruation app</em>.</p>\n<h1>How to Use <strong>ebb</strong></h1>\n<h2>Step 1: Choose the Date</h2>\n<p><strong>ebb period tracker</strong> provides 2 options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>now (today's date)</li>\n<li>not now (choose a specific date)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step 2: Log Flow + Symptoms</h2>\n<p><strong>ebb period tracker</strong> will ask you to record symptoms along with either menstrual flow or cervical fluid. There are several <strong>custom</strong> slots to personalize the log. If a category is not selected, the fields in your ebbtracker file will be left blank.</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Make <strong>ebb</strong> Flow for You</h2>\n<p>I added features to let <strong>ebb period tracker</strong> adapt to you (and not the other way around). The <strong>Notes</strong> section is where I journal or put other information, like if I took my medication for the day; when I took a self-care moment; or maybe I need to vent about the \"cramps before the storm\". The <strong>Tags</strong> section = keywords. I've added a \"doctor\" tag to symptoms that I want to discuss with my doctor or mental health professional. Tags is also where all custom categories are saved</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If \"save\" is selected, the Notes and Tags sections will be left blank.</p>\n<p>When finished, <strong>ebb period tracker</strong> will do its thing, and vibrate to alert you it's done. Best of all: you don't need to sign up for a premium service to get backup capabilities; with <strong>ebb period tracker</strong>, the backup file lives at <em>/Shortcuts/ebb/ebbtracker.txt</em>. Import the file into a spreadsheet program, transpose the columns and rows, and experiment with the possibilities!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Disclaimer</em></strong>: <strong>Ebb</strong> tracks location to access the daily weather forecast (may not work for entries with past or future dates). Weather conditions can affect symptoms, i.e. headaches. This information is <strong>ONLY</strong> saved to the ebbtracker file. To exclude weather conditions, turn metadata to \"false\" (how-to visual available in the shortcut). This will not affect recorded data and can be reversed at any time.</p>\n<h1><strong>And that's it!</strong></h1>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<p>This shortcut has been designed using resources/inspiration from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com\">flaticon</a></li>\n<li>Jackson Dame's<a href=\"https://www.jacksondame.com\"> Harnessing Tech challenge</a></li>\n<li>the subreddit on Shortcuts, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/\">r/shortcuts</a></li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>3.5 - Aug. 10, 2021, 5:24 a.m.</strong></p><p>Changes include: fixing the TIMESTAMP section of an updated entry to reflect the new date + time; fixing an issue where the headers are dropped from the ebbtracker.txt file when updating or deleting an entry; and various bug fixes + editing to improve consistency + flow.</p>"}
