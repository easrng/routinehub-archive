You can assign it to a keyboard shortcut or to a menu bar action.</p>\n<p>Ideal set up instructions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>When installing the shortcut, you will be asked to enter the name of your VPN as it appears in system preferences.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once you enter that and save it, you can bind it to a keyboard shortcut. Shortery is a good way to do this, but you can use macOS's native actions to bind it to such. You can also place it in your menu bar.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>IMPORTANT: this has not been tested with VPN services like Proton, Mullvad, Keep Solid, Express, ETC. it \"theoretically\" should work, but has been tested on my own personal WireGuard server.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - April 19, 2022, 1:17 p.m.</strong></p><p>Official release!
