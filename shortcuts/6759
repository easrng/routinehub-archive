It works great with either method. But the smoothest experience is through running it from a widget.</p>\n<p><strong>Custom icons created with Fancy Icon Maker<br>Look Ma ... No Labels</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pppnrpv.jpg\"></p>\n<h1>How Fancy Icon Maker Works</h1>\n\n<p>The first thing you will see when you run Fancy Icon Maker is the main menu. It contains four options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customize App Store App</li>\n<li>Customize System App</li>\n<li>Instructions</li>\n<li>Settings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your first step for creating a custom icon is to select one of these options.</p>\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LJg7a4I.jpg\">\nThen you enter the name of the app you want to add or select a system app from the menu, pick the Icon you want, the label you want and you are done customizing that app. \n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/O1V5snZ.jpg\">     <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/496bTwk.jpg\"><p></p>\n<p>Repeat this process with each app you want to create a custom app for. Once you are done creating icons, select <strong>Create My Fancy Icons</strong>  to go to the icon installation screen. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EIBNzMu.jpg\"></p>\n<p><br> <br>\nFollow the instructions there and all your custom icons will appear on your Home Screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Extended Demo of Fancy Icon Creator in Action</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH43K0gSdCY\"><img alt=\"iOS 14 Fancy Icon Promo\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mC0aM4l.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><strong><em>HOT TIP</em></strong> - Enter a blank space in the label name to create custom icons with no name.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Fine Print:</em></strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fancy Icon Maker creates custom home screen icons by installing a file called a configuration profile on your device. Other custom icon shortcuts may make you install individual configuration profiles for each app you want to customize. Fancy Icon Maker letâ€™s you install as many custom icons as you want all at once. When you delete an icon, the icon remains stored on your device unless you delete the entire profile. </li>\n<li>The configuration profiles created by Fancy Icon Maker only contain web clips (like the home screen bookmarks you can add from safari or shortcuts). The magic is that these web clips let you open apps directly from the home screen. </li>\n<li>Visit <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/webclip\"> Apple's Web Clip information page</a> for more information about web clips.</li>\n<li><strong>Note:</strong> there are 6 system apps which do need to open through shortcuts - Calculator, Camera, Clock, Contacts, Phone, Voice Memo and Weather</li>\n</ul>\n<h3> Enjoy Using Fancy Icon Maker!</h3>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.3 - Feb. 23, 2021, 1:37 p.m.</strong></p><p>WARNING: iOS version 14.5 and later will permanently break Fancy Icon Maker.
