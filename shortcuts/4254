{"id":"4254","name":"SF Symbol for vCard Menu","tagline":"used to create and encode an Apple SF Symbol for a vCard menu","icon":"ios14 c4292093695 g59445","latest":"26631","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A video demonstration of this shortcut is available <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/emv2eu/sf_symbol_for_vcard_menu_used_to_create_and/\">here</a> (reddit, /shortcuts).</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Important Caveat</h3>\n<p>This shortcut, <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4254\">SF Symbol for vCard Menu</a> uses the <strong>Create Icon</strong> action included in <a href=\"https://toolboxpro.app\">Toolbox Pro</a>. This action requires the <strong>Toolbox Pro Premium</strong> in-app purchase. </p>\n<p><em>Toolbox Pro</em> is an amazing utility for the <em>Shortcuts</em> app. If you develop shortcuts, do yourself a big favor and install it today. You'll be amazed how it extends the capability of your shortcuts. Many of the additional actions it provides are free, but as mentioned above some require an in-app purchase.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of this shortcut is to generate encoded photos suitable for shortcut vCard menus. All photos are based off one of the 1500+ <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/\">Apple SF Symbols</a> thanks to the <em>Toolbox Pro</em> <strong>Create Icon</strong> action.</p>\n<p>To create a vCard menu, the encoded photo that this shortcut generates can be pasted into the location indicated below (in a <strong>Text</strong> action).</p>\n<pre><code>BEGIN:VCARD\nVERSION:3.0\nN;CHARSET=utf-8:Main Text For Item 1;;;;\nORG:Optional sub text for the 1st menu item;\nPHOTO;ENCODING=b:_ENCODED PHOTO INSERTED HERE_\nEND:VCARD\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since the encoded photo is a very long string of text characters, it is more partical to paste the text into a <strong>Dictionary</strong> action <em>Text</em> value and then reference that dictionary value in <strong>Text</strong> action. See below for an example.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Application</h3>\n<p>If you are going to create a shortcut only for yourself and you have made the <strong>Toolbox Pro Premium</strong> purchase to activate the premium actions (IMHO <strong>well worth</strong> the nominal cost), the <strong>Create Menu</strong> action would be the quickest and easiest way to create <em>vCard-style</em> menus. In fact, it appears that the <em>Toolbox Pro</em> author, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mralexhay\">Alex Hay</a>, is planning to add some <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/em3orb/making_progress_with_toolbox_pros_quick_menu_tool/\">additional menu features</a>.</p>\n<p>However, if you plan to create and share a shortcut and you can't be certain that the users will have purchased <strong>Toolbox Pro Premium</strong>, then the approach discussed in the previous section should be used. This is when <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4254\">SF Symbol for vCard Menu</a> becomes useful.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>The operation of <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4254\">SF Symbol for vCard Menu</a> is simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose one of the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/\">Apple SF Symbols</a>.
