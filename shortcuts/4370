I’ll be honest, I made this shortcut simply because I got tired of starting 7 minute timers every time I was baking cookies (hence the name).</p>\n<h1>How is this useful</h1>\n<p>At first glance this shortcut isn’t a huge time saver or particularly useful. However, when paired with Automations, you can really see the usefulness.</p>\n<p>Using an NFC chip (easily bought online in the form of stickers, which conveniently can be stuck right on an oven or other places you always need a timer started), you can run this shortcut really quickly.</p>\n<p>At least, that is how I use this shortcut. You are obviously free to use it however you want.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.2 - Jan. 21, 2020, 10:11 a.m.</strong></p><p>Added comments and fixed order of actions</p>"}
