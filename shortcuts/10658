It then creates a single task the day before you’re traveling called “Pack for x” (where x is where I’m going). It has a deadline of the day you travel. That task has a checklist with all the things you need to pack. It also adds another “Pack for return home” task that is set the day before you return home (with a deadline of the next day). It has the same checklist as the first one and helps you make sure everything is packed for the return trip.</p>\n<p>This shortcut is extensible. Each top level dictionary is a list of things for the type of trip you are going on. New “lists” can be added but you will need to add new text fields for those. You can also customize the text fields to your liking, though I have some things I usually take included to get your started. The first text field is the “essentials” list and should include everything you are taking regardless of the type of trip you are going on.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Dec. 13, 2021, 3:40 a.m.</strong></p>"}
