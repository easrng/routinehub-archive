The notification works but Epic keeps updating their JSON feed and I don’t always have time to catch it. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Free on Epic Games iOS Shortcut\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YrgD8lD.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Free on Epic Games displays the current and upcoming free games listed in the Epic Games Store. You can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get reminders about current and upcoming games</li>\n<li>Share the game’s info</li>\n<li>Visit the game’s webpage</li>\n<li>Update via UpdateKit</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n\n<h4>Get Notifications When Games are Free</h4>\n<p>You can also run the shortcut as a daily automation (with any input) and it will send you a notification when a new title becomes free. </p>\n<p><strong>A Note on Automation Timing</strong>: So far, Epic updates free titles every Thursday at 11:00AM GMT -5:00 (US Eastern). You can set your automation to run only after that, but you may miss daily items, eg, the Christmas promo daily updates.</p>\n<hr>\n\n<h4>Roadmap and Known Issues</h4>\n<p>As of 2/4/2020: When multiple titles are free, the shortcut will only send a notification for one. The full shortcut displays multiple Free Now titles correctly.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.2 - Jan. 17, 2021, 3:07 p.m.</strong></p><p>Rev UpdateKit meta. Oops.</p>"}
