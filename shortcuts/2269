{"id":"2269","name":"Workday Availability","tagline":"Easily share your availability via a list of free blocks of time","icon":"ios12 c2071128575 g59681","latest":"6665","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Generates a list of your blocks of free time based on the events in a single calendar, which you can then email, copy to your clipboard, or share using the share sheet. Example output:</p>\n<pre><code>I have the following availability:\n\nMarch 21 (Thursday)\n   9:00 AM - 12:00 PM\n   1:00 PM - 3:30 PM\n\nMarch 22 (Friday)\n   8:30 AM - 10:00 AM\n   11:00 AM - 12:00 PM\n   1:00 PM - 4:00 PM\n\nMarch 23 (Saturday)\n   No availability\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are a lot of calendar availability shortcuts out there, but none of them met my needs, so I made this one. It will work best for people who have similar work hours each day and who don't need or want travel time to be automatically calculated for them.</p>\n<p>Set your options when you install by answering the configuration questions. You can also access the configuration wizard at any time from Workday Availability's shortcut settings.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set the start and end times for your typical work day as a persistent preference. No availability will be shown outside of these times.</li>\n<li>Query your availability for a single day, or for a range of days. Availability will be displayed for each day in the range given.</li>\n<li>Will ignore all-day events unless their titles contain a certain phrase (chosen by you), such as \"Out of Office\". Shortcuts is unfortunately unable to filter calendar events by the native \"busy/free\" time flag, so this is necessary.</li>\n<li>Define the minimum amount of time for a block to be considered \"free\". Either set this as a global preference, or set to zero in order to be asked on each run.</li>\n<li>Provides multiple ways to get the availability list out of Workflow, including via Mail, Gmail, copying to the clipboard, or via the share sheet. (Note that Gmail <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/forum/AAAAK7un8RUGB7Ufj6u3zM/?hl=en\">doesn't properly handle line breaks</a>, so the output is copied to the clipboard for you to paste.)</li>\n<li>Refers to events from only one calendar (because I use multiple calendars, most of which don't represent appointments/busy times).</li>\n<li>Does not attempt to account for travel time. (I feel that doing this well would require making too many assumptions about how the user utilizes the calendar.)</li>\n<li>Supports UpdateKit.</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1 - March 22, 2019, 1:54 a.m.</strong></p>"}
