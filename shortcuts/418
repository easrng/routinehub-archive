A spam messenger for your iPhone without the lazy copying and pasting. You can prank your friends and family with this shortcut! Just simply launch the shortcut, choose a contact, say what you want to say and how many times you want to send it. </p>\n<p>Sadly, for lag purposes. You can only send it up to 100 times. I will update this in the future, but it currently sends up to 100 messages. </p>\n<hr>\n<p><b> If you are not on iOS 15, or you cannot update due to an older device, I have a final iOS 12 version, which should get you everything, excluding the cap (I believe). </b> If you want to use this, please use this <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/download/6711\">link</a>. </p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Spam Messenger:</h4>\n\n<p>Version: 1.2</p>\n<p>Requires iOS 13 or later.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - Aug. 13, 2020, 9:34 p.m.</strong></p><p>• This update supports iOS 14. This may work on iOS 13. <br>• For now, messages are capped at 100 messages. Please run the shortcut multiple times if you want to send more than 100 messages. This may be removed in a feature update or the number for recommendation might be increased in a feature update. <br>• Other improvements and bug fixes.</p>"}
