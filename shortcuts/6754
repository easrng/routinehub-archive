It really helps me know what I should add/fix :)</strong></p>\n<p>This is a simple shortcut that gets the information about an article and saves it to a new note in a folder of your choice. The info it gets is the article title, the author, the upload date, an excerpt from the article, and a link to the article. This is a useful shortcut to have because it allows you to quickly get all of the necessary information to share an article with someone.</p>\n<p>Planned Updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Option to choose what information you need from the article</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Option to choose formatting (this will include MLA citation)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You have to manually go into the shortcut and enable access to ”Notes”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The shortcut currently takes a few seconds to fetch the data and format the preview (not sure if I can fix this because it may just be an issue with Shortcuts)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The shortcut doesn't work on all articles (unfortunately, I don't think I can fix this since it's most likely an issue with some articles not being recognized by the shortcuts app).
