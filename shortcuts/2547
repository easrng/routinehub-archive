First, it asks for your input method. You can either use voice input or just use the keyboard. Note that it will automatically choose keyboard input if you are not connected to the internet. \nThen you get to choose the difficulty. The Ultimate Number Guessing Game features 3 difficulties, which include easy (1 ~ 10), Hard (1 ~ 1000), and Entertainment (1 ~ almost infinity). Each has corresponding chances. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"alt text\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1P8jBmP.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Next, you guess what you think the random number is. It will hint you whether your guess is higher or lower than the number.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"alt text\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lhmtwpl.jpg\">  </p>\n<p>The rules are just as normal: you guess the number within the given chances, you win. Otherwise, you lose. This shortcut is equipped with advanced programming, so it tells you how many times you've guessed if you win, and how many numbers were close to the answer if you lose. This shortcut also has plural detection, which means you will not see the (s) with annoying parentheses sticking behind every word. This shortcut is function based.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"alt text\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/diTteys.jpg\"></p>\n<p>This shortcut has UpdateKit integrated, so users can get the latest updates whenever the developer pushes them. </p>\n<h2>This is the first real shortcut I made, hope you like it. Please leave feedbacks if any bug occurs, or just for suggestions. I will be fixing them ASAP.</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"alt text\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YijK1MC.png\"></p>\n<p>Graphics made with <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911\">MediaKit</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.6.5 - Sept. 22, 2019, 9:25 p.m.</strong></p><p>- Shortcut is function based.<br>- Optimized for iOS 13, kept the original blank when entering a guess with keyboard, since it automatically fills with a 0 as default if you leave it blank when making the shortcut in iOS 13.<br>- Changed “guess a number” to “guess an integer” in the game rule.<br>- Added a function where it can detect whether you entered anything using dictation, as well as if you entered a number or something else.<br>- Optimized for UpdateKit 6.0.
