Since this shortcut is inspired by ‘Cookie Clicker’, I’ll just give the link to it here: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/962/</p>\n<p>If you have any suggestions, please feel free to suggest something in the comments section below! If there is a bug or a glitch, please also tell me in the comments!</p>\n<p>If you download this shortcut, then here’s a thank you from me, &amp; @DidiDidi123.</p>\n<p>Thank you for downloading DidiClicker! :)</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.1 - Sept. 23, 2021, 9:35 a.m.</strong></p>"}
