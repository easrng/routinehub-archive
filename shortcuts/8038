Major functions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shutdown Pi</li>\n<li>Restart Pi</li>\n<li>Direct terminal input</li>\n<li>Open Pi-hole admin in Safari</li>\n<li>Open router admin in Safari</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By default, the shortcut will prompt for password, but in practice I recommend generating a key. You will need to fill in the Piâ€™s ip, port, user, and machine name. Router admin page defaults to 192.168.0.1 but can be changed as well.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.1 - Jan. 9, 2021, 4:12 a.m.</strong></p><p>Removed unnecessary permissions for iCloud</p>"}
