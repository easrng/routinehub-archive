Compatible with iOS 13/12.","icon":"ios13 c463140863 g59771","latest":"15271","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This is probably the first shortcut for Camera uploading. With this shortcut, it takes your recently taken photos and videos, and upload them to the folder camera uploads folder in your dropbox.\nThe number of photos that are uploaded is 21, and the number of videos uploaded will be 26 videos. The limit is necessary, so that way you won't have to wait forever. You also might not get the request timed out message unless video clip so long. When I first made the shortcut, I tried to see how much I could add, and do any more than this will most likely cause the request timed out error message. That is why the uploads are 26 videos and 21 Photos.\nOnce they are uploaded, you'll be able to see them normally. once you go to your dropbox and go to your camera uploads folder, you'll see your uploads there. Got any feedback or suggestions? Leave them down below in the comments.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - March 8, 2020, 1:36 a.m.</strong></p>"}
