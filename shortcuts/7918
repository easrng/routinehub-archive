Most of us are usually on a known network at a known location when we run our scripts. </p>\n<p>Rather than having code in every location aware script to check to see if you are at 'home' or 'work' you can use this script to record those known addresses in you iCloud Drive. Then when you call this script, it will grab that file, and if you are on a WiFi network that you have recorded and address for, it just returns that address.</p>\n<p>If you are not on WiFi that you have recorded, it will do the normal, slow, location lookup, and return it. So you can just use this helper script anywhere you would normally issue a \"Get current location\" request, and dramatically speed up your shortcut when you are in your most common locations.</p>\n<p>Record a new location by calling this script from another script, but send \"SetUpNewLocationBasedOnWifi\" as the Input.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.01 - Dec. 28, 2020, 1:15 a.m.</strong></p><p>Added update checking.</p>"}
