Normally saving a Jupyter Notebook, a JSON or an SVG file directly from Safari is troublesome because Safari does not trust many file extensions. With this shortcut it would be easier.  </p>\n<h1>How to use it</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Open any text based file in the browser (or long press a link) and select and open the shortcut with the share menu.  </li>\n<li>In alternative, you can copy the link to the text based file in the Clipboard, and them open the shortcut directly. It will use the link from the Clipboard to save the file.  </li>\n<li>Select the extension that you want for the file or type the extension yourself. You can also choose to save the file with no extension, or to find the original filename from the URL.  </li>\n<li>DONE! :D  </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>REQUIREMENTS</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>None. Both Safari and the Files app are included in iOS.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h1>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Shoculad/\">Shoculad</a> for suggesting a way to avoid resorting to javascript for sorting and ansi escaping.</p>\n<h1>INFO</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>2022-06-26 v1.2.0</li>\n<li>Author: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fremenmuaddib/\">u/fremenmuaddib</a>  </li>\n<li>This shortcut is canonically available on RoutineHub at https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12378/</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2.0 - June 27, 2022, 9:14 a.m.</strong></p><p>- removed the need to resort to javascript for sorting and ansi escaping</p>"}
