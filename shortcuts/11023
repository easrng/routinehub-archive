With most other backup shortcuts, you only backup shortcuts that have been recently modified. However, they usually miss updating shortcuts that:</p>\n<p>1) have been moved to a shortcut folder</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>2) have since been deleted but not modified on shortcuts (most apps cannot detect this and solely go off of modification date of the actual shortcut on your phone)</p>\n<p>This app ensures that your backup is indeed stored in iCloud and will create a backup should it ever get removed. In that sense it ensures your backup library is up-to-date as well as complete and maintains a reliable backup inventory.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Allows backup of specific shortcuts or folders</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check for new changes function. This also finds backups that have been since deleted or moved to a different folder</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complete backup and update library functions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Compatible with automations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Read instructions in shortcut for more info</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This took many days of debugging and was a headache to construct but the result was worth it. Please let me know if you find any bugs or loopholes.</p>\n<p>Features that may be added in updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Setup Menu</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Restore backup function</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.05 - Feb. 8, 2022, 5:18 a.m.</strong></p><p>Streamlined some items </p>"}
