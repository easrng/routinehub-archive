Those are the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Medium widget size only</li>\n<li>You must choose 4 contacts</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Additionally, because Apple has neutered widgets in iOS 14, this app will have to launch WidgetPack before it prompts you with a call button. So that kinda sucks, but its not that bad.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.7 - Oct. 1, 2020, 11:48 p.m.</strong></p><p>For contact photos with very low resolution, version 0.6 didn’t fixed the squished images.
