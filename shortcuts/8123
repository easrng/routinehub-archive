(Only took 8 seconds to check through 300+ shortcuts on iPhone XR)!<br><br>- The previous 2 versions of this shortcut replaces the number found with a new value throughout the whole source. Let's assume a shortcut is using a glyph number 59393 and has a lot of base64 images. There's a chance that some of the images contain the same string 59393 because base64 encoding turns binaries into mostly alphanumeric characters. Then the image will break if you use Replace Text in source.plist because it will find ALL occurrences of 59393. This was a problem that has been squashed in the new version of this shortcut.<br><br>- Results shown in a Quick Look before generating iCloud links for shortcuts detected will now also be saved in the Note with the links.</p>"}
