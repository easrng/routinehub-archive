There is no customisation to this; itâ€™s set to streetmap view, and the zoom level cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can download the companion shortcut https://routinehub.co/shortcut/560 which lets you use Google Maps instead. Here, you can choose the map type and zoom level.</p>\n<p>Google Maps thumbnails require a Google Maps API key.
