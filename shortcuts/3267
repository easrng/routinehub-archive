They serve different solutions. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Setup\" src=\"http://magaimg.net/img/8khd.jpg\"></p>\n<p>When you run your javascript in headless mode you have to use document.write(...) to produce output results, so long as your javascript is synchronous you can manipulate the document that is passed as output. </p>\n<p>If you have an asynchronous action (time-out, Ajax, etc) you have to use the visible mode which requires a manual user action to produce output. This is done by using the users clipboard as data Passthrough mechanism. (It restores the original clipboard content when itâ€™s done). To pass results to the users clipboard in visible mode you must call <code>shortcutResult({...})</code> when your script has finished its work. This will prompt the user to tap a button which will populate their clipboard. </p>\n<p>Input accepts an array of urls for external scripts that need imported for your script to run.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3246\"><img alt=\"Used by ShortcutML\" src=\"http://magaimg.net/img/8khi.png\"></a></th>\n<th><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3260\"><img alt=\"Used by ShortcutNLP\" src=\"http://magaimg.net/img/8khj.png\"></a></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.0 - July 27, 2019, 6:09 p.m.</strong></p>"}
