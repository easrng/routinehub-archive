{"id":"8079","name":"HawkUpdater","tagline":"The modern successor to old updaters","icon":"ios14 c4251333119 g59693","latest":"25144","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>HawkUpdater</h1>\n<h3>Why HawkUpdater?</h3>\n<p>HawkUpdater was built for functionality, but it looks great, too. It works with only about 150 actions. For perspective, the average Updater uses 300-400 actions.\nThis is because HawkUpdater uses the latest technologies such as JavaScript engines, hidden features, and more.  </p>\n<p>It also contains clear and distinct UIs, utilizing Unicode bolded text and italics and vCards.</p>\n<h3>Integration</h3>\n<p>Like most modern updaters, HawkUpdater is extremely easy to integrate. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download HawkUpdater. </li>\n<li>Add two actions to your shortcut: </li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"integration.png\" src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/mkvYZPxV/image.png\"> </p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the dictionary, put the <strong>name of your shortcut</strong>, the <strong>shortcut ID</strong> (the number in your routinehub link), and the <strong>current version</strong> of your shortcut. Basically, if you know how to use UpdateKit or Demon Updater, you can use this.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That’s it! To check for updates to HawkUpdater, just run it on it’s own.\nFor a detailed integration guide, see the Handbook.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: HawkUpdater 0.08 and lower can only handle single decimal version numbers. Starting with 1.0.0, HawkUpdater can function with multiple decimals. The transition between beta and 1.0.0 can break things, so back up your Shortcuts if you are still running 0.08.</p>\n<h3>Client Use</h3>\n<p>“That’s all well and good, but what can <em>my</em> clients expect?”<br>\nThis is the core of HawkUpdater. Depending on how you integrate HawkUpdater, whenever you publish a shortcut update to routinehub, your users will be notified of it. An alert will appear with details like the version number, update notes, and more. Your clients can then either <strong>install</strong> the update, or <strong>ignore</strong> it. </p>\n<p>As of beta 0.08, HawkUpdater also notifies of rollbacks, so you can be sure that your clients will only get the most stable updates and features.</p>\n<p>However, HawkUpdater is not only one of the most useful Updaters, but is also one of the most <em>stylish</em>. HawkUpdater offers things other updaters don’t have: themes. Utilizing vCard menus, HawkUpdater allows you and your users to customize the look of HawkUpdater however you want! </p>\n<p><img alt=\"menu\" src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/cLdcPS53/A0-C7-A2-CA-9644-427-D-9570-8642-DFBA7381.png\"></p>\n<h3>Beta</h3>\n<p>As of 1/15/2021, HawkUpdater is no longer in beta. Keep the feedback coming, though!</p>\n<h5>Upcoming</h5>\n<p>I’ll be adding quite a bit of features soon.
