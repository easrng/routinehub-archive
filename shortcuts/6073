So this shortcut no longer works.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://m.imgur.com/a/WisAMhA\"><img alt=\"iOS 14 Fancy Folder\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JB6oIor.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><img alt=\"example fancy folder\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8kvUnDM.png\"></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/O8bagnM.jpg\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://Imgur.com/TLBr2XL\">Click here to see a video of the folder creation process</a></p>\n<p>If you like Fancy Folder Maker, be sure to check out:\n* <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6759/\">Fancy Icon Maker</a> for a way to make custom homescreen icons\n* <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7387/\">Blank Icon Maker</a> for a way to make blank icons for your homescreen\n* <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7613/\">Blurred Background Frame</a> for a way to create a blurred background frame for your homescreen</p>\n<p><strong><em>Five Easy Steps to Fancy Folders</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>STEP 1</strong> - Enter the names of the apps you want in your folders</p>\n<p><strong>STEP 2</strong> - Choose A name for your Fancy Folder</p>\n<p><strong>STEP 3</strong> - Choose whether to use round or icon shaped images in your Fancy Folder</p>\n<p><strong>STEP 4</strong> - Open the Link to your Fancy Folder</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Three Easy Steps\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/e3XtGWC.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>Optional</strong> - To make Fancy Folders More Useful, you can add them to the home screen or iOS 14 widgets and trigger them from there (you can even customize the home screen folder’s icon)</p>\n<p><img alt=\"home screen icons\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8Wtr6yt.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>Hot Tip</strong> - you can change whether your Fancy folder uses round menu icons or icon shaped menu icons. To get round icons, find the 5th action in your generated Fancy Folder shortcut (which says “If system version does not contain 14”) and change the number 14 to 13. You will now have round icons. If you have round icons already, change the number 13 to 14.</p>\n<p><strong>Another Hot Tip</strong> - To add apps not available in the US App Store:\n1) Go about half way through the shortcut to where there are two “Search App Store” actions. Expand those actions and select the App Store region you want to use.\n2) Go about 4 actions further down to the get url action “https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=StoreID” and add your app store’s region code after the .com. For example, to search the uk store add “/gb” The new url should be “https://itunes.apple.com/gb/lookup?id=StoreID”.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.191 - March 7, 2021, 4:29 p.m.</strong></p><p>Added 2 comments at beginning of generated Fancy Folder shortcuts first with name of generated shortcut.
