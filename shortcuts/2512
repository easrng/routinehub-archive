Users can set the duration of heating in the setting. Then, it will run silently in your pocket to keep your body warm! This is pretty useful in a cold outdoor environment. After startup, it will give you three choices. Whether to start heating, reset the device, or configure the heating duration. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"alt text\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uIHshG9.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Considering your battery health, heating will not proceed if your battery is below 20%. The heating is achieved by setting the brightness of your device to max, turning on the flashlight, then coding and decoding a short piece of video repetitively. To keep the shortcut running, just leave the screen on and set it somewhere like in your pocket. Or even, set it on your hand. After a certain amount of time, it notifies you that the heating is finished, and it resets the brightness to what it was before heating, as well as the flashlight. If you interrupted and quit the shortcut during heating, that's also an easy fix. Just press \"Reset Device\", it will do the same thing. Yet nothing will happen if you accidentally press it without actually proceed to heat. The shortcut is integrated with UpdateKit, so you'll always have the latest version ready. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"alt text\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/K0y9T3k.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Of course, you can customize whether you want to update it or not, so it won't annoy you every time when you use the shortcut. </p>\n<h2>Please leave feedbacks if any bug occurs, or just for suggestions. I will be fixing them ASAP.</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"alt text\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YijK1MC.png\"></p>\n<p>Graphics made with <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911\">MediaKit</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.5 - Sept. 22, 2019, 9:16 p.m.</strong></p><p>- Optimized for iOS 13.
