Examples include,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Coffee with Jeff Saturday 6:31am\n555 Main St, Palo Alto, CA some more text...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>12:47 pm tomorrow lunch with James 4567 Capital Ave, San Jose, California\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pickup up cake at  <a href=\"http://safeway.com/\">Safeway</a> 1444 Shattuck Pl, Berkeley, CA 94709 Wednesday 3pm</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pick up Susan </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These could be in an email, web page, or a document. So how to quickly and easily add to your calendar? </p>\n<p>This shortcut allows you to <em>either</em> <strong>select</strong> the text and use the Share menu to run the shortcut <em>or</em> <strong>copy</strong> the text and run  the shortcut and the shortcut will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attempt to find any address in the text to put into the location field.</li>\n<li>Attempt to find dates and set them. Any date will be used as a default start time and you will be able to update it in a nice iOS dialog. The end time defaults to 60 minutes after the start time.<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Note you can use friendly terms like, “today” “tomorrow” or “Monday” as well as actual dates and they will be converted for you. No time found will default to 12pm.  </li>\n<li>If you set start and end times to the same value it will be an all day event.</li>\n<li>If no date is found, it will default to today.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The title of the event is editable from the shortcut.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The text you select might be Rich Text like HTML. If so, you can choose to keep the formatting or convert to plain text for the Note field of the event.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The idea is to have a fully formed event ready to go. When you finish setting up your event, you can set it to open open in the following browsers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Brave</li>\n<li>Chrome</li>\n<li>Firefox</li>\n<li>Safari</li>\n<li>Apple Calendar</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can confirm any details, clean up any mistakes, and save the event. Voilà! You have an appointment.</p>\n<p>This now works two ways:  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>For <strong>Google Calendar</strong>, choose your choice of browser.<blockquote>\n<p>Note I’m using a browser to add the calendar item because as far as I know there is no way to access the native <strong>Google Calendar</strong> app for this job.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>For <strong>Apple Calendar</strong>. You need to configure two things in the shortcut for this to work:<ul>\n<li>Your Email </li>\n<li>And choose \"Email\" as the Browser. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This will make an ICS file and mail it to you. Open that in your native iOS client and you can import the appointment.</p>\n<h2>Info</h2>\n<h1>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h1>\n<p>This shortcut has an integrated update mechanism called  <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\">Embed-a-Update</a>. Thanks to the embedded updater, it does not require any external updater shortcut. The shortcut checks for updates itself, so you'll never miss an update and it is super fast. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cpBjhE3_d.webp?maxwidth=1000&amp;fidelity=large\"></a>\n</p><p></p><p></p>\n<p>If this Shortcut doesn’t work as expected, you have suggestions, or an idea to improve it, let me know!</p>\n<h3>Related Shortcuts</h3>\n<p>You may also like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5326\">Share Availability</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5773\">Import ICal File</a> this allows you to import ics files saved to your device or grab them from any website.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.7 - Jan. 16, 2020, 11:43 p.m.</strong></p><p>Now supports native iOS Calendar too.</p>"}
