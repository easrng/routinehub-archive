In this game, you need to avoid being sent to a representative in order to reach 9 possible endings. The game is supposed to reflect the annoying nature of customer support hotlines.</p>\n<p>Includes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>• An achievements system to track your progress!</p>\n<p>• A bunch of duct tape.</p>\n<p>• Mysterious to be solved (a major stretch, this game is pretty short)</p>\n<p>• A <em>revolutionary UI!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>Final - Sept. 2, 2022, 6:40 a.m.</strong></p><p>This is the definitive edition of The Hotline Game. No further updates will be made, unless something in future versions of iOS renders the game unplayable.<br><br>Changes in this version:<br>- Accommodations for iOS 15: restoring the original path of the Hotline Game folder, removing actions that have been rendered useless in future iOS versions, etc.<br><br>- Minor script changes to make the objective clearer.<br><br>- You can now play with the audio off! You will receive a prompt for this when you first open the game, and this can be modified in the game settings as well. Turning audio off skips the text-to-speech, so prompts appear quicker- however, the best experience is with audio on.<br><br>- When game audio is turned off, prompts that weren't transcribed into text are now transcribed.<br><br>- You can switch the \"Hotline Mode\". There are 2 options: Original, and True-to-life. Original plays the game with text prompts, and True-to-life plays it without.<br><br>- Warnings now pop up whenever you try to set game audio off, and turn on True-to-life. The option is still given to you.<br><br>- 2 new achievements have been added. Not telling you where they are, tough luck.<br><br>- UpdateKit support has been removed, as per usual.</p>"}
