You will need to have 7 JPG files labeled as days of the week (or one, that’s copied 7 times and each copy is labeled a different day of the week, or whatever combination you can think of) and make sure that they are labeled such that it is like “Friday.JPG” “Sunday.JPG” etc. (click get info on the JPG file, and it should show that labeling in there. DO NOT type .JPG in the space where you label the file). I set the automation on my iPad to be everyday at 2am.\nYou will need to set up a folder containing these JPG files, and give it a name that you want, which would require changing the ““get file from “dailywalpap” at path “Formatted Date .JPG””</p>\n<p>to </p>\n<p>““get file from “(whatever file name you choose)” at path “Formatted Date .JPG”” Assuming nothing changes when I share the shortcut, the date formatting will be EEEE in both the format variable, and the “show more” box of the variable (click the arrow on the variable in iOS to see the same thing).</p>\n<p>I downloaded it right after I published it, and I worked on my iPad just fine.</p>\n<p>non-binary: my iPad (9th gen) was running iOS 15.4.1</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - April 5, 2022, 5:44 a.m.</strong></p>"}
