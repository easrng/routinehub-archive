It lets you make a custom dictionary of base 64 encoded images for use in your shortcuts (a new shortcut is created with the image dictionary as its only action).</p>\n<p><strong>Top Level Dictionary</strong>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/og79I4F.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>Sub-Dictionary with image names and base 64 values</strong>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Xr5ACrz.jpg\"></p>\n<p>If you make a lot of shortcuts you have likely come across the need to embed images in your shortcut. Perhaps itâ€™s for a vCard or maybe an image for an html welcome screen. If you want to save the images locally in the shortcut, they have to be base 64 encoded. </p>\n<p>The base 64 text can be saved in a text box and converted or in a vCard in a text box. But that is both ugly and, in the case of vcCards, obscures the balance of the text. Also, if you have a lot of images, it can slow down the shortcut on loading.  </p>\n<p>There is a better way to do this - saving the base 64 encoded images  inside a nested dictionary and referencing the images from there. </p>\n<p>This shortcut does exactly that, easily and efficiently in a few simple steps:\n* Pick the image you want to use from a file or your photos\n* Enter a new size for the image or keep the current size\n* Enter a name you want to call the image or use the file name\n* Repeat for each image you want to use\n* Give a name to the image set\n* Create the dictionary\nImage Dictionary Maker is the easiest way to get your images into your shortcuts</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.1 - Dec. 2, 2020, 2:03 a.m.</strong></p>"}
