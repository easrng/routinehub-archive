No updates, no file downloads. Easily customizable so that you can add all your most groceries with one run of the widget/shortcut. You’ll get a notification when the items are successfully added, which will tell you the number of items and (if less than 12) will list the items in the notification.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1 - May 3, 2019, 11:48 a.m.</strong></p><p>1.0</p>"}
