Originally created by /u/osnipassos and tweaked by /u/bradart, /u/redv1ew und u/lentys. Original shortcut can be found here: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/115378903bd9482987c3c7a6af7b8bdd and through this reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/9jm2wu/any_tip_for_making_a_pomodoro_timer_shortcut/</p>\n<p>There are six steps in the original technique:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Decide on the task to be done.</li>\n<li>Set the pomodoro timer to 25 minutes</li>\n<li>Work or better complete on the task</li>\n<li>End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper</li>\n<li>If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (5 minutes), then go to step  2.</li>\n<li>After four pomodoros, take a longer break (30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From the original shortcut-Post: \nThe stages of planning, tracking, recording, processing and visualizing are fundamental to the technique. In the planning phase, tasks are prioritized by recording them in a \"To Do Today\" list. This enables users to estimate the effort tasks require.</p>\n<p>My changes:\n- asks for a new or existing task everytime a 25 minute iteration starts\n- changed short breaks to 5 minutes\n- added my LaunchCuts tags (can be removed)\n- added Things and Drafts to my personal version</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - Feb. 6, 2021, 2:26 p.m.</strong></p><p>Minor Bugfixes</p>"}
