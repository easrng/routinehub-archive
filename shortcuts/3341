You should use an image with the aspect ratio of 1:1 as input, else the result could be unusable. The aspect ratio of the nine output images is 1:1. The height and width of those nine pictures depends on the height and width of the input picture. It is 1/3 of the inputs width.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.3 - May 29, 2021, 9:52 p.m.</strong></p><p>Support for iOS 14 added</p>"}
