Works with links, Safari pages, or a URL on the clipboard. </p>\n<p>First the Shortcut will expand the URL if it is shortened. Then a series of “search &amp; replace” operations will strip-out common tracking parameters before opening the “cleaned” link in Safari.</p>\n<p>Items removed from links include  Google Analytics trackers, Facebook trackers, CoreMetrics/IBM Digital Analytics, hashed email addresses and more.</p>\n<p>The approach is based on the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/kiding/589242021df49eb17be3/\">safari-utm-stripper Bookmarklet</a> from Github. It also borrows heavily from patterns provided by the <a href=\"https://github.com/Smile4ever/Neat-URL/\">Neat URL extension for Firefox</a>.</p>\n<p>Rate the Shortcut or tweet at @mobilemind.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.0 - Oct. 13, 2018, 6:29 a.m.</strong></p>"}
