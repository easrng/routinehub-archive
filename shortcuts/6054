FOR NOW !!! </h1>\n\n<p><img alt=\"AnonyGram and Download\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tzCwTc1.png\"></p>\n<h1>AnonyGram and Download</h1>\n\n<p>AnonyGram and Download is a shortcut that allows you to follow public Instagram profiles anonymously and download their stories and posts easily.\n<br><br></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautiful Interface\" src=\"https://imgur.com/inJ6lqS.png\"></p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<h3>Private </h3>\n\n<p>It's made with privacy in mind. The shortcut uses the built-in webview, so no browser history. The list of accounts you follow are encoded so spotlight won't show the usernames. If you want to delete everything, it's a press away.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Privacy Customizations\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/rxV6GS3/IMG-3753.png\"></p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<h3> Password Protected </h3>\n\n<p>You can also password protect the shortcut using a PIN of your choice. No one without iOS Shortcuts expertise will be able to see who you follow.</p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Pin Code\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/pKsN7YW/IMG-3303.png\"></p>\n<p><br><br>\n</p><h3> Add from Instagram </h3>\n<p>Follow new accounts on AnonyGram directly on Instagram! Simply press “share” on a post of the person you want to follow, scroll down until you find AnonyGram. Confirm your intent and it’s done!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Add on Instagram\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/r7sdJ9z/IMG-3329.png\"></p>\n<p><br><br>\n</p><h3>Easy management</h3>\nYou can easily follow and unfollow accounts. <p></p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautiful and easy interface\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/BKFBFt3/IMG-3754.png\"></p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<h5> Search </h5>\n\n<p>Search users with the new searchusers.com integration. Easily add the found users to AnonyGram via share sheet.\n<br><br></p>\n<h5> iCloud Sync </h5>\n\n<p>If you use Shortcuts with iCloud, all of your settings (including pin) and accounts you follow will keep synced!\n<br><br>\n</p><h5>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h5><p></p>\n<p>AnonyGram and Download has an integrated update mechanism called Swing Updater[E]. Thanks to the embedded updater, this shortcut does not require any external updater shortcut. The shortcut checks for updates itself once per day, so you'll always be up to date and never miss an update.\n<br><br>\n<img alt=\"Works with instagram\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Kdzx6j.png\"></p>\n<p><br><br>\n</p><h6>With love, made for SVB❤️ and the world, </h6>\n<p> by @8isnothing. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>contact: 8isnothing@protonmail.com</p>\n<p><br><br>\nSpecial thanks to MediaKit</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.261 - Jan. 19, 2021, 12:13 a.m.</strong></p><p>- Improvements in base64 encoding and <br>- Bug fixes in Password Protect</p>"}
