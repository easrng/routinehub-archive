{"id":"530","name":"MultiBikeShare","tagline":"Tired of searching for bikes/scooters through multiple apps? Problem solved.","icon":"ios12 c4282601983 g59783","latest":"1697","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In many major cities, a huge number of bike/scooter share programs exist. The common practice is to download each service's app, configure it, and when ready to travel, look at each to determine the closest bike/scooter. That's a nightmare. If you're wanting a 6-block ride to get your lunch before your next meeting, you don't want to spend 5-10 minutes across 4+ apps, searching for the nearest vehicle with enough battery.</p>\n<p>Enter MultiBikeShare, the shortcut to quickly find the nearest bike/scooter. Currently, MultiBikeShare supports the following services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bird</li>\n<li>Lime</li>\n<li>Razor</li>\n<li>Spin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>...with more to come.</p>\n<p>Once the nearest bike/shooter is found, MultiBikeShare will open the appropriate app (Bird, Lime, etc.). In cases where MultiBikeShare can't open the app, it will open Maps with walking directions.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> For the shortcut to work, it is important to create accounts for each of the services you wish to use.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.3 - Nov. 7, 2018, 3:09 a.m.</strong></p><p>- Made geo lookup much faster</p>"}
