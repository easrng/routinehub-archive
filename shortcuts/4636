Simply add the stuff you need to find every once in a while, tell the Shortcut where you last put that thing, and then you’ll be able to ask Siri where that thing was. </p>\n<p>I wrote these shortcuts out of frustration of continuously losing things around the house, forgetting where those things were, and not having anyone to ask who might know. Now, if I lose the keys, my box cutter, my passport, etc. I can just ask Siri via Found It.</p>\n<p>Technically, this is four separate shortcuts:\n1. Found It, which contains all the functionality of logging items, tracking them, and updating the location\n2. Help Me Find Something, which just asks Siri where something is\n3. I Moved Something, which just informs Siri where something has moved to\n4. Keep Track of Something, which just informs Siri of a new item you want to track</p>\n<p>You can also easily create specialized shortcuts to ask about specific items (eg. “Where’s my wallet?”) by passing a text value representing the item (eg. Wallet) into one of the shortcuts.</p>\n<p>All the data containing your items and their locations are stored securely in iCloud Drive.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.00 - Feb. 24, 2020, 1:48 p.m.</strong></p>"}
