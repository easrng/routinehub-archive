PDF files are considered to be the most commonly used format for sending documents. However, some systems or emails may have requirements regarding the size of uploaded files. For example, I can think of government agencies that can only receive attachments around 2 megabytes in size. As a result, many users want to reduce the size of the PDF.

Please choose one or more image file(s) from your Photo Library to create a reduced PDF! (This is done by image reduction)</p>\n<p>3.)
