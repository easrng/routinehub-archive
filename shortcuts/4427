{"id":"4427","name":"SF Symbols Utility","tagline":"a tool to display names, categories, restrictions, and images for Apple SF Symbols","icon":"ios14 c4292093695 g59786","latest":"26505","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A video demonstration of this shortcut is available <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/ewbovh/sf_symbols_utility_a_tool_to_display_names/\">here</a> (reddit, /shortcuts).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The purpose of this shortcut is to provide information about Apple <em>SF Symbols</em>. More information can be found at the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/\">Apple Human Interface Guidelines</a></p>\n<p>Please note: If you have the <a href=\"https://toolboxpro.app\">Toolbox Pro iOS app</a> installed and you have paid for the <strong>Premium</strong> in-app purchase, <strong>SF Symbols Utility</strong> will include graphic previews of the Apple <em>SF Symbols</em> (shown below). </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>Using the first menu item, <strong>Symbol Details</strong>, you can select any of the 1672 Apple <em>SF Symbols</em> and view the  <em>Category</em>, <em>Restrictions</em> (if applicable; more about that below), and symbol <em>Image</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bpJuZqf.png\">\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Up1bL7.png\"></p>\n<p>Using <strong>Symbol by Category</strong> you can select any of the 19 <em>Categories</em> (or UNCATAGORIZED) and then view the <em>SF Symbols</em> in that category. Any of the symbols in that category can be selected, or you can search from a subset by typing a portion of a symbol name. </p>\n<p>In the example below, a restricted symbol was selected, thus the pertinent information was returned, including a link to the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/\">Apple Human Interface Guidelines</a>. Note that Apple refers to these as <strong>Symbols for Use As-Is</strong>.</p>\n<p>Note also that the selected symbol is in two <em>Categories</em>. Most <em>SF Symbols</em> are in one, but s few are in two and several are UNCATEGORIZED. This group can also be browsed using the <strong>Symbol by Category</strong> menu option. UNCATEGORIZED appears at the end of the list.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ymvhPwO.png\">\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NTlaUNf.png\"></p>\n<p>Using <strong>Restrictions</strong> you can see a view of all 58 <strong>Symbols for Use As-Is</strong>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZHPkeXS.png\"></p>\n<p>Using <strong>Image Files</strong> you can generate a small image file (approximately 4K) for each of the <em>SF Symbols</em>. These files are saved to iCloud and placed in subfolders based on category(ies). Using <em>iOS Files</em> or <em>macOS Finder</em>, you can get a nice preview of the <em>SF Symbols</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6MWiWb9.png\"></p>\n<p>The primary data used by this shortcut can be viewed using the <strong>Symbols Dictionary</strong> menu option. This information could be used in other shortcuts that employs <em>SF Symbols</em>. For an example, see <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4254\">SF Symbol for vCard Menu</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that the bulk of this dictionary information was obtained using the powerful <em>Get Symbol Name</em> action included in <a href=\"https://toolboxpro.app\">Toolbox Pro</a> <strong>Premium</strong>. That data was combined with <strong>Symbols for Use As-Is</strong> information from the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/\">Apple Human Interface Guidelines</a> and organized using another shortcut that generated the dictionary displayed here. Since that shortcut is likely not useful to others, I've not published it on RoutineHub.
