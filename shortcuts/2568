{"id":"2568","name":"Base64 Encoder","tagline":"The most intuitive and useful Base64 Encoder/Decoder.","icon":"ios12 c431817727 g59727","latest":"8007","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><img alt=\"alt text\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mpdvsUt.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>Base64 Encoder</h2>\n\n<p>This is the most easy-to-use Base64 Encoder/Decoder out there. After starting up, there are only two simple choices in the menu: encode or decode. The process is straightforward, you can choose to encode photos/videos, audio, or emojis (I think this one's pretty useless but anyway, I put it on there just in case).  This shortcut is for situations where you can only send and receive texts. If you want to send a picture to someone, you can simply encode it into Base64, and the other side can decode it back to an image. Same to video, audio, and emoji. Once it encodes a file, it will notify you and automatically copies it into your clipboard. The decoding process couldn't be easier. You just press decode, (if you have your Base64 code ready in your clipboard already), and choose paste from clipboard. There goes your file. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"alt text\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZrhLaX8.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Another really useful feature this shortcut has is, it supports share sheet import. For example, when you are viewing an image on anywhere (like a webpage) and want to encode it. Just select share, Shortcuts, and choose Base64 Encoder. All it does is copying the encoded Base64 code into your clipboard and quit. Straightforward and simple! </p>\n<p><img alt=\"alt text\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NtI5kpR.jpg\"></p>\n<p>This Shortcut also has UpdateKit integrated, so users can get the latest when the developer push them. Another very important fact worth noting is that this shortcut stores absolutely nothing in the user's iCloud Drives. Plus, this shortcut has been optimized for full widget support, which you can run the entire menu within the widget itself. It's beautiful.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"alt text\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/t8VXjZn.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>Please leave feedbacks if any bug occurs, or just for suggestions.
