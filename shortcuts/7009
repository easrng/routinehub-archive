Formerly it would give the menus with blank variables, which caused some confusion. Unfortunately Spotify or Apple Podcasts do not work very well with shortcuts without some real skill (which I do not have). Also added a change log inside the shortcut, mainly for me but is also there for you if your curious lol.</p>"}
