This is for reference and can be used in any shortcut.</p>\n<p>Full disclosure: I did not come up with this method by myself. I saw a similar technique in an early version of <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6166\">DTwitter</a> by <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/user/heismauri\">@heismauri</a> and adapted it to handle videos from the Photos app instead of Twitter. I have shared this snippet quite frequently, so Iâ€™ve published it on RoutineHub to avoid creating more iCloud links for the same shortcut.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Dec. 30, 2020, 6:12 a.m.</strong></p>"}
