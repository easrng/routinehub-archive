Theres some example stuff at the beginning, delete/change it before adding to your snippet library, or leave it in so you can remember how to use it when you copy it into your Shortcut.\nAs. With a lot of html stuff you may need to escape out any text</p>\n<p>Timeline css/html was from a tutorial, and not by me.</p>\n<h2>Snippets</h2>\n<p>This is a snippet for adding to your Shortcuts using a tool like <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3724\">MergeCuts</a> or <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3761\">ActionCuts</a>. You can use either of these tools to add useful sets of reusable actions into your Shortcut. Or you can just use it as a starting point for your Shortcut.</p>\n<p>Some snippets/ActionBlocks published may have examples in, or not quite work the way you want, make sure you <em>customise them before adding them to your library</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Snippets are meant for adding to a Shortcut and not for running by themselves.</em> They may not do anything by itself, and you may need to send something into one of the actions in order for it to work eg through a variable in your Shortcut.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Mhvk8g7/08-D96-FF3-121-E-431-F-ADED-76-F0939-AB7-D2.png\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1 - Nov. 3, 2019, 11:49 a.m.</strong></p>"}
