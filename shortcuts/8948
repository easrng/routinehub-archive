This is useful for any apps that you want to add that extra layer of security to - just because you give your unlocked phone to someone to use, it doesn't mean they should be able to access everything on your phone without your permission. </p>\n<p>SET UP:\n1) Go to the Clock app, and under Timer select When timer ends -&gt; 'Stop Playing'.</p>\n<p>2) Add and configure the AnyAppLock shortcut by completing setup. </p>\n<p>3) Add and configure the AnyAppLock Helper shortcut, selecting the corresponding AnyAppLock shortcut you added previously, when prompted to do so.</p>\n<p>4) Create an automation for the app you chose, When \"App\" is Opened, and in the Automation Actions add Run Shortcut -&gt; AnyAppLock Helper. Turn off 'ask before running'.</p>\n<p>5) Done! On your first run the shortcut will complete setup and ask for some necessary permissions, accept all of those and then when you relaunch the app you will have a functioning app lock!</p>\n<p>This is my first shortcut, I hope you find it useful(: Any feedback / comments, leave them down below.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.01 - April 17, 2021, 1:24 a.m.</strong></p><p>-Removed 'save clipboard to notes' function due to a Shortcuts bug where the code wouldn't always execute properly.</p>"}
