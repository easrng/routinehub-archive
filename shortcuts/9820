If it disappears, save command should be pointed to Downloads/Popclip Extensions</p>\n<p>Icons\nIf you want to add it yourself add the icon to the .popclipext folder and edit the config.plist to add the filename of the icon. Otherwise it will just use the name.  </p>\n<p>For best results, the icon should be a square PNG file at least 256x256 pixels in size. The image should consist of a black figure on a transparent background. You can use opacity to achieve 'shades of grey'.</p>\n<p>Advanced\nYou can send different information across if you want to edit the shell script eg the URL of any text being highlighted. Look at the script fields.\nhttps://github.com/pilotmoon/PopClip-Extensions#script-fields</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - July 31, 2021, 4:32 p.m.</strong></p><p>Now selects Shortcut rather than asking for name.</p>"}
