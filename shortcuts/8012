{"id":"8012","name":"World Time Zones","tagline":"Converts a date/time to multiple time zones doing all the math for you","icon":"ios14 c946986751 g59412","latest":"30917","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><img alt=\"iOS 15: Works (iOS 15.1 beta 2)\" src=\"https://atnbueno.com/ios15_ok.png\">\n<strong>iOS 15:</strong> Works (iOS 15.1 beta 2)</p>\n<p>This shortcut converts a date/time to the local time in multiple time zones. You can share a date/time with the shortcut or have it in the clipboard.</p>\n<p>After you do any final adjustments visually, the shortcut will convert that to a list of dates and times in multiple time zones. These will be listed with their corresponding labels.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Enter a date/time to get the local times in all the time zones\" src=\"https://www.atnbueno.com/time-zones-input-output.png\"></p>\n<p>You can customize your time zones and labels in the dictionary you'll find in the shortcut.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Define your own list of time zones and their labels!\" src=\"https://www.atnbueno.com/custom-time-zones.png\"></p>\n<p>In addition to the <em>Time Zones</em> you can tweak the output via the <em>Replacements</em> in the same dictionary, as well as the output <em>Date/Time Format</em>.</p>\n<p>As seen in the original configuration, the shortcut supports <strong>uncommon time zones</strong> (:30 and :45 offsets) as well as <strong>daylight savings</strong> peculiarities (see for example on 2020-11-01 between US and the EU). iOS doesn't support all the time zone abbreviations, but for those that can be expressed as \"UTC+hh:mm\" all year long, that format is also supported. An additional trick: if you want to list two places with the same time zone, and that time zone uses daylight savings, you can use both abbreviations interchangeably (e.g. PST and PDT, EST and EDT, and CET and CEST).</p>\n<p>Since version 1.2.0, the shortcut dialog and date/time output formats can be localized. In version 1.3.0 the available languages are: English (default), Spanish, Catalan, French (thanks to <strong>Tito12</strong>), Turkish (thanks to <strong>lildogi</strong>), and Polish (thanks to <strong>MrocznyTMC</strong>).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://v.redd.it/9ewhd86fdl961/DASH_720.mp4\"><img alt=\"screenshot linked to video\" src=\"https://www.atnbueno.com/world-time-zones.png\"></a>\nClick the image to see a video demo</p>\n<p>Are you fluent in a language not ones already listed? Translate just three short text fragments and tell me the usual date/time format in that language. If you understand the JSON format, this is what the shortcut needs for every language:</p>\n<pre><code>\"en\": {\n    \"LOCAL TIME\": \"Local Date\\/time?\",\n    \"OUTPUT TITLE\": \"“%s” is equivalent to\",\n    \"COPY OUTPUT\": \"Copy to the clipboard?\",\n    \"Date\\/Time Format\": \"MMM d, h:mma\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can also translate the names of the cities and countries to another language. Example in Spanish:</p>\n<pre><code>\"Replacements\": {\n    \"\\\\(US\\\\)\": \"(EEUU)\",\n    \"\\\\(Mexico\\\\)\": \"(México)\",\n    \"\\\\(Canada\\\\)\": \"(Canadá)\",\n    \"\\\\(Ireland\\\\)\": \"(Irlanda)\",\n    \"\\\\(UK\\\\)\": \"(RU)\",\n    \"\\\\(Spain\\\\)\": \"(España)\",\n    \"\\\\(Japan\\\\)\": \"(Japón)\",\n    \"London\": \"Londres\",\n    \"Mexico\": \"México\",\n    \"Mumbai\": \"Bombay\",\n    \"New York\": \"Nueva York\",\n    \"Porto\": \"Oporto\",\n    \"St. John’s\": \"S. Juan de T.\",\n    \"Chatham Is\\\\.\": \"Islas Chatham\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A more advanced step is to generate the replacements to align the output. Contact me if you want to help with this in another language:</p>\n<pre><code>\"Replacements\": {\n    \":(1\\\\d\\\\w*)\": \":$1 \",\n    \"(?m)(?&lt;=^\\\\w{3})( \\\\d?1),\": \"$1, \",\n    \"(?&lt;=:\\\\d\\\\d)a..m.\": \"am\",\n    \"(?m)(?&lt;=^\\\\w{3})( 1\\\\d?),\": \"$1, \",\n    \"AM\": \"am\",\n    \"PM\": \"pm\",\n    \"( \\\\d):\": \" $1:\",\n    \":(\\\\d1\\\\w*)\": \":$1 \",\n    \"(?&lt;=:\\\\d\\\\d)p..m.\": \"pm\",\n    \"(?m)(?&lt;=^J[au]n|Apr|Oct)( \\\\d\\\\d?),\": \"$1, \",\n    \"(?m)(?&lt;=^May)( \\\\d\\\\d?),\": \" $1,\",\n    \"(?m)(?&lt;=^\\\\w{3})( \\\\d),\": \"$1, \",\n    \"( 1\\\\d):\": \" $1:\",\n    \"( \\\\d?1):\": \" $1:\",\n    \"(?m)(?&lt;=^Jul)( \\\\d\\\\d?),\": \"$1, \"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>TODO</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add support for time zones abbreviations not supported by iOS, by using the new \"Convert to Time Zone\" action (e.g. Sydney → AEST)</li>\n<li>Simplify the process of text pseudo-alignment</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.3.4 - Dec. 8, 2021, 12:18 p.m.</strong></p><p>Second try to fix the midnight to early morning bug.
