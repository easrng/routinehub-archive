You put on pajamas, water the plants, brush your teeth, and lock the door.\n<br><br>\nYou do this every night, but sometimes forget to water the plants or lock the door.\n<br><br>\nYou decide to use a checklist, but you have to reset it every night to use it again.\n<br><br>\nThat's where <strong>Checklist Pro</strong> comes in.\n<br><br>\nUnlike most checklist applications, <strong>Checklist Pro</strong> doesn't keep your progress.\n<br><br>\nThis means that you don't have to reset or remake a list everytime you use it on a repeated task.\n<hr>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oRjdh2L.jpg\"><p></p>\n<p></p><hr>\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\">Supports [Embed-a-Update]</a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911\">\nMockups created with MediaKit</a>\n<br>\nÂ© 2020 TheGoodDude22<p></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.2.1 - April 25, 2020, 2:23 a.m.</strong></p><p>Updated Icons</p>"}
