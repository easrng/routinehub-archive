Then add the soundboard to your home screen.</p>\n<p>Not quite sure what the limits will be with this, so don't go mad for a 50 clip board all at once. \nWill take mp3/4s, not ogg but should be quite easy to add.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/TcSCdnK/i-VBORw0-KGgo-AAAANSUh-EUg-AABS0-AAAo4-CAYAAAC8-Jo-K-AAABgml-DQ1-Bz-Ukd-CIEl-FQz-Yx-OTY2-LTIu-2.png\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1 - June 20, 2019, 7:25 p.m.</strong></p><p>Small updates for iOS 13</p>"}
