{"id":"4986","name":"Set Calculator","tagline":"Allows you to see if there are any sets among a number of cards from the card game Set","icon":"ios13 c2071128575 g59685","latest":"16114","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Set is a game where there are a number of Set cards on the table, usually 12, and players race to identify a \"set\" of 3 cards. Each Set card has 4 properties, color, shading, shape, and the number of shapes. There are 3 different options for each property (For example, a card can only be red, green, or purple). A \"Set\" is a group of 3 cards, where each property, when looked at individually, is either all the same or all different. Each card either has the same color or all different colors, either the same shading or all different shadings, either the same shape or all different shapes, and either the same number of shapes or all different numbers of shapes.</p>\n<p>My shortcut allows you to input any number of Set cards, and it will tell you what the sets are that can be made from the given set cards if any. </p>\n<p>It first asks how many cards you have. Input a number. Then it will repeatedly ask you for the number of shapes, the shading, the color, and the shape, using Menus. I chose this order because I believe this sounds most natural when you say it aloud. Then, it will spend some time calculating, and finally, it will list out every set it found, or if there were no sets.</p>\n<p>It does take a bit of time, but that's because this version only uses the shortcuts app. I have another, much faster version that uses a Scriptable script, but that requires the Scriptable app.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.0.0 - April 11, 2020, 12:18 a.m.</strong></p><p>Updated the algorithm that actually finds the sets within your cards.
