Uses the difference between the two results provided by Drivey’s <code>Get time stamps</code> action to calculate the total time elapsed in seconds. <em>(This doesn’t appear to make it any more accurate because Drivey seems to natively return the result in minutes as its smallest unit.)</em>\n2. Divides the result of Drivey’s <code>Get last trip distance</code> action by said time elapsed.\n3. The result (in miles per second) is multiplied by 3600 to calculate the desired output in miles per hour.\n4. The output is logged via an <a href=\"https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/append-to-file/\">Append to File</a> action pointed toward a directory specified by the user at installation.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"DriveyQR\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/151585842-b13f5ab1-c130-496f-845c-973ba471fe86.png\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Jan. 28, 2022, 7:13 p.m.</strong></p>"}
