Just hit play and let it read you your daily summary while you get ready for the day. </p>\n<p>At the end, if you requested directions to your calendar event, it will create a reminder of when to leave. BUT! I included a callback URL in the reminder notes that will launch my other shortcut “<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/971\">Calendar Event ETA</a>.” Just force press the reminder when it goes off and dive into the directions to your event!</p>\n<p>If you run into problems, please leave feedback so I can fix any issues.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Made by\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pi013nc.jpg\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.2.3 - Dec. 16, 2018, 4:58 p.m.</strong></p><p>Improved accuracy of location-fetching for scheduling travel reminders</p>"}
