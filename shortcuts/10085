Personally, I have this running each day, but it could be performed whenever you wish.\n    <img alt=\"Automation check of prices\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GKOXOES.png\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Examples of Price Difference(s) Found</h4>\n<p>If there is a price difference found for an app in your list, you'll get a notification when the check is performed.\n  <img alt=\"Price differences examples\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/onSrNZO.png\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8067\">u/gluebyte for Screenshot Framer shortcut used to generate the screenshot images</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1906\">u/ROP for MediaKit Badges used to generate the badge on this page</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.02 - Sept. 8, 2021, 6:03 p.m.</strong></p><p>- Fixed the broken import questions ðŸ˜ </p>"}
