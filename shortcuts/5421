If only two colors are chosen when generating a multicolored GIF, the color names will be separated by an `&amp;` symbol. If three or more colors are chosen, the color names will be separated by commas and the last color in the list will be separated by an `&amp;` symbol.<br><br>- Added `Supported by Swing Updater` subtitle text for the `Check for Updates` option.<br><br>- Added a new icon into the `Circles` category named `Circled Blank`. This icon does not have a glyph whatsoever and only utilizes a shortcut icon background color instead. The new glyph can be found at the bottom of the list in the `Circles` category.<br><br>- Removal of an unnecessary `Otherwise` action block followed by the action after it before the `End If` action block.<br><br>- This update comes with a total increase of +12 actions used in the shortcut.</p>"}
