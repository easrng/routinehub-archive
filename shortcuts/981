It doesn't do anything practical, its a starting point for creating you're own easy to use tables for viewing on mobile devices. </p>\n<p>This version will take csv and show as a table, please note it only deals with very simple csv, there's no dealing with escaped characters, or different flavours of csv at all. The csv is in as a Text Action at the top of the Shortcut. I have no idea if it will work with excel csv etc, I'm not trying to build a csv conversion tool that works for every use case, just give people a tool to build something useful to them.\nie name,address,tel will work  <br>\n \"name\",\"address\",\"tel\" wont work</p>\n<p>DataTables is used to show tables in a way that works better for mobile, with pagination, search, responsive tables and will bunch data with expand/collapse to make it easier to work with on mobiles.
