Wished you could easily save/share both of those? Well that’s what this Shortcut does. Select Live Photo(s) and run it from the share sheet, or run the Shortcut directly and select Live Photo(s) when prompted. You’ll then receive a bundle of the photo(s) and video(s) extracted from your Live Photo(s) at the share sheet ready to send/save wherever you’d like.</p>\n<p>Note: For those curious, the actions to zip and unzip before sharing at the end work around a weird iOS bug that affects sharing via Messages.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - July 7, 2021, 4:47 p.m.</strong></p><p>First release.</p>"}
