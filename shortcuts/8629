He threw together a fake website, a fake company, and a bunch of GMail addresses with scripted replies.</p>\n<p>Every time he received a scam email, like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Example of a scam email\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuBubFaWgAYIXuF?format=jpg&amp;name=small\"></p>\n<p>He sent the following message in reply:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"The reply email Boris sends\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuBubhaWgAAbr7f?format=jpg&amp;name=small\">\nAnd the rest is, well, history - as scammers go bonkers with a back and forth series of emails which eventually fustrates the crap out of them and wastes their time.</p>\n<p>Call this shortcut from your Mail application's share sheet in a reply, and it copies this text to your clipboard ready to paste and send in response.</p>\n<p>Then just sit back, knowing that an email scammer is going to be driven insane.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.02 - March 7, 2021, 6:50 a.m.</strong></p><p>Spelling correction.</p>"}
