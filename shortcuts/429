Rather than have 30 battery shortcuts, the goal here is to make one with a menu to select an option:</p>\n<p>•Normal\n•Normal (Wifi Only)\n•Low with Wifi\n•Low with Cellular\n•Ultra Low\n•Charging\n•Charging with DND</p>\n<p>Now intelligently saves last brightness level. It does not save it when switching <em>to</em> normal modes, and uses a default normal brightness (75%) if the saved level is less that 50% when switching to normal modes.</p>\n<p>Should be easy enough to customize. Displays the current battery level and brightness in the menu title, and makes a recommendation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/4mo6IzU.png\">Screenshot</a></p>\n<p>Credit goes to just about everyone who's made a battery shortcut so far.
