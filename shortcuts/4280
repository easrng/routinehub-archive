Read the description to see how to prevent file loss and recover files in case of file loss.</p>\n<p>Hello everyone,</p>\n<p>I finally spent the time to “finish” up one of my first projects!</p>\n<p>This shortcut allows you to work with hidden files in the iOS Files app like you have not been able to before. It will allow you to make a file hidden, unhide a hidden file, view hidden files, as well as delete hidden files.</p>\n<p>Now there is 1 major issue which is what caused me to not finish this a year ago and that is that you can’t seem to select an entire folder (which is required to access hidden files) in Document Picker. What this means is that, as of now, you can hide files in both iCloud Drive and On My iPhone, however you can only unhide, view, and delete from within the iCloud Drive Shortcuts folder. I hope to update this shortcut with the solution if Apple every allows it. So be careful with bidding files outside the iCloud Drive Shortcuts app.</p>\n<p>Troubleshooting: If you happen to hide a file you cannot seem to access, if you have a Mac you can press “Command-Shift-.” and access your iCloud Drive to see hidden files outside the Shortcuts folder. If you have lost a hidden file in the On My iPhone section, you can connect it to your computer with an application that can view the filesystem to remove it.</p>\n<p>Please please please, let me know if you run into any issues, have any performance suggestions, or feature suggestions.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions please let me know and I will try to address them!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>3.1 - Jan. 17, 2020, 3:59 p.m.</strong></p><p>Made menu items dark and light mode compatible</p>"}
