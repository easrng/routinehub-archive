This will remove all of the “query” or “search” params. In simpler terms, everything after the ‘?’ in the URL will be removed, including said punctuation.</p>\n<p>The only exception is the video ID in YouTube URLs. More exceptions may be added later.</p>\n<p>Be careful when initially using this Shortcut, as YMMV. It may do too much or too little for you.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Aug. 21, 2022, 12:33 p.m.</strong></p><p>Initial release.</p>"}
