{"id":"12463","name":"University of Chicago Press’s Monthly Freebie","tagline":"Shows a notification with the title, author and cover of this month’s free ebook from UChicago Press","icon":"ios15 c463140863 g61442","latest":"33993","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This shortcut scrapes University of Chicago Press’s website and retrieves the title, author, publication year and cover image for their selected free ebook of the month then displays a notification. Clicking on the notification will trigger an alert asking if you want to download the book — selecting OK will open the relevant webpage so you can enter your email (they’ll send you a link for the file). Perfect for running automatically at the start of each month (I run it on the 4th because they don’t always update it on the 1st).</p>\n<p><em>[Not affiliated with UChicago Press in any way, just a fan of free books!]</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - July 4, 2022, 5:04 a.m.</strong></p>"}
