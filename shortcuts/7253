Once a character is dead there will be an \"‚ùå\" infront of their name. Each turn starts with telling you who some of the characters were with. If someone dies figure out who in the group it could have been. Rule out the characters until you find the imposter. The imposter may either sabatoge your vote or force you to solve a question in 7 seconds, if 7 seconds passes once you solve the question you will lose even if the answer is correct. Enjoy!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.5 - Nov. 5, 2020, 3:21 p.m.</strong></p><p>Added the ability for the imposter to sabatoge and get vent kills.</p>"}
