Below is the README notes for the Shortcut. There is also a small companion Shortcut that will re-run the Setup Assistant to change any preferences. I plan on building this out to add more features, but for now...</p>\n<h1><strong>CarGreeter, v1.0</strong></h1>\n<p>Created by Shawn Clary</p>\n<p>*<em>This shortcut will need access to iCloud Drive on first run to save settings.</em></p>\n<p>Welcome to CarGreeter!  In order to get the most out of this shortcut, read the important information below. I designed it to work beautifully with CarPlay Automation (sort of, see below), however it works just as well over Bluetooth Audio!</p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT CarGreeter</strong></p>\n<p>This shortcut will greet when run and relay important information depending on what time it’s being run, if you’ve already ran it today, give you weather conditions and check for any upcoming appointments and automatically get directions. She even starts some music when finished, if you want, all with a friendly smile -err, voice!</p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT AUTOMATION SETUP</strong></p>\n<p>I originally created this Shortcut with the intention to have it run automatically when you activate CarPlay. However, when doing this (in my car, at least) Siri’s voice cuts in and out. It seems like Apple isn’t giving Shortcuts a lot of processing priority when they are set to start automatically. It’s also possible that the issue could have to do with the actual processing capabilities of the Car. I'm reaching out to Apple to find out. I hope this gets resolved. It runs nearly perfect when running it by just tapping the Shortcut. I personally created a nice big Shortcut Widget on my Home Screen to run manually until this gets resolved.</p>\n<p>But I encourage you to give it a whirl on your system. The instructions are inside the Shortcut in <strong>AUTOMATION SETUP</strong>. You could also have this run automatically when you &lt;insert anything here you do first in the car&gt; like playing a certain playlist. Get creative!\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>RESETTING CarGreeter SETTINGS</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to run the setup again to change your preferences, run the companion CarGreeter Shortcut provided.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong></p>\n<p>There is a separate comment inside the Shortcut dedicated to some known issues. One particularly irksome issue is the shortcut uses a low quality Siri voice. I believe I have figured out a workaround for the next version. Stay tuned. If you want, you can edit the voice in the Shortcut for EACH of the speech items or implement the fix yourself (create a variable \"voiceSelection\" and set the all to use the variable - this was not clear as an option you could choose). See the <strong>KNOWN ISSUES (1)</strong> inside the Shortcut in the app.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p>If you find anymore bugs, let me know! Email me at <a href=\"mailto: sleeptil3software@gmail.com\">sleeptil3software@gmail.com</a>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>DISTRIBUTION</strong></p>\n<p>Feel free to distribute and/or edit. I do ask you include a “version 1.0 by Shawn Clary\" if you add new features. If you do add some cool features, kindly share it back to me! If you allow me to implement, I will credit you in the README.\n <br>\n<br></p>\n<p>—————————\n<br>\nCONTACT INFO:\n<br>Email: sleeptil3software@gmail.com\n<br>Website: www.sleeptil3software.com\n<br>\n—————————</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Feb. 13, 2021, 5:08 p.m.</strong></p>"}
