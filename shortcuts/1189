If the difference exceeds a specified <em>build delta</em>, display an alert. See below, <em>top left</em> screenshot.</li>\n<li>To display a \"welcome\" alert the first time the shortcut is started AND if a specified <em>number of days</em> have elapsed since the shortcut was last run. See below, <em>top-right</em> screenshot.</li>\n<li>To display a daily alert. See below, <em>bottom-left</em> screenshot.</li>\n<li>To automatically check for a shortcut update if a certain number of days have elapsed since the most recent check. See below, <em>botton-right</em> screenshot.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Emkyjkc.png\">\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vClvQoM.png\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Tests</h3>\n<p>This shortcut was tested using <strong>iOS 13.3.1 (17D5026c) beta 1</strong> on an <strong>iPad Pro 10.5\"</strong> and an <strong>iPhone 8 Plus</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Let’s Share Shortcut Techniques</strong> is available exclusively on <a href=\"https://routinehub.co\">RoutineHub.co</a>.

It was referencing 'Settings File'; it has been corrected to 'Settings Path'.) <br>- The 'Get Value for Start Time in File' was incorrectly referencing (via a magic variable) the 'Get File' action in the previous section. Because of this bug and the previous, the shortcut worked as expected. Two wrongs made a right; sometimes you get lucky, even with bugs!)</p>"}
