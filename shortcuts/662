This could be City Photos, Portraits, Travel, etc.</p>\n<p>The shortcut asks you when you first open it in the Siri Shortcuts app which three sets of hashtags would you like to set up by default. You can add more at the end of the process.</p>\n<p>This shortcut is also running UpdateKit, this will allow me to update the shortcut should any future updates by Instagram release and break the shortcut, this can be hopefully for not too long. It also allows me to add any new features to enhance this shortcut should Apple add any more awesome options to improve this shortcut.</p>\n<p>You use Captions over hashtags in your posts and only put them in the comments? Maybe then \"Get my IG Caption Template\" Siri Shortcut is better suited to you! &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/720\">Get it here!</a> &lt;&lt;</p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"http://joshdeakin.com/\">http://joshdeakin.com</a>\nClick my username to the left for Dictation Shortcuts &amp; other type shortcuts.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.3 - Nov. 1, 2018, 9:37 a.m.</strong></p><p>* Fixed bug with “Import Questions”<br>* Fixed bug with Version Number for UpdateKit functionality.</p>"}
