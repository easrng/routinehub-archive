The tool, while originally developed in 1983, remains a popular choice for helping us understand how different situations affect\nour feelings and our perceived stress. The questions in this scale ask about your feelings and thoughts during the last month. In each case, you will be asked to indicate how often you felt or thought a certain\nway. Although some of the questions are similar, there are differences between them and you should treat each one as a separate question. The best approach is to answer fairly quickly. That is, donâ€™t try to\ncount up the number of times you felt a particular way; rather indicate the alternative that seems like a reasonable estimate.</p>\n<p>Description from https://das.nh.gov/wellness/docs/percieved%20stress%20scale.pdf</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Feb. 7, 2022, 5:20 p.m.</strong></p>"}
