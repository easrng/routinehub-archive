Finally bringing this shortcut in line with the Sonarr shortcut in terms of features and menu options. I've lost track on exactly everything that changed. But here are the high lights.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added queue menu. View download queue or view download history for the past 10 items.</li>\n<li>Renamed edit menu to 'advanced'.</li>\n<li>Added caching of movie menu items. This greatly improved the speed for searching for movies. And accessing any menu that required a compiled list of shows. Which means fewer repeated steps in each menu. Movie cache will update periodically and when adding a new movie.</li>\n<li>Added sorting of selecting releases based on quality weight, this should place the more relevant releases on top of the search results.</li>\n<li>Fixed incorrect sourcing of key when searching for movies. Therefore fixing returning a ton of unwanted profiles.</li>\n<li>Added rich notifications in all notifications that support it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An easy to follow setup will run on first run of shortcut. </p>\n<pre><code>1)  If you want to add 4K movies\n2) API Key.
