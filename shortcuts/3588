With:</p>\n<pre><code>- WAN support. No more local only restrictions.\n- All commands are now API based! No more SSH.\n- CREATE CONTAINERS. You can now create containers using whatever template image you have hosted on your Proxmox server. You pick the OS template, storage location for the new container, which SSH key you will be attaching to it at creation, IP and even if you want it powered on after creation.\n- All configuration variables are stored in your own iCloud Drive and not the shortcut itself. If files that are needed do not exist, you will be prompted to create it on first run. (You should still make a restricted 'api@pam' user to run this with).\n- Bulk actions have been removed in favor of consistency. But will be added back soon.\n- Updating container underlying OS has been removed.\n</code></pre>\n<p>SSH version is still published under a new shortcut link. You can re-download at the following link. All config files for 3.0 use a new path, so your SSH configurations will still be valid. SSH based shortcut will no longer be maintained.\n    https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3592</p>\n<p>Planned 3.0 improvements. \n    - deleting containers\n    - CEPH status\n    - Cluster support\n    - Container migration\n    - Snapshots/backup management\n    - More detailed container information\n    - Proxmox firewall support</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>3.90 - May 19, 2020, 11:30 p.m.</strong></p><p>Version 3.90<br>ProxMox API file in iCloud should be deleted and rebuilt.
