The generated text is copied to the clipboard and can either be used as a shortcut input or manually entered (paste) into text fields. Users can also choose between Lite and Full options—without downloading any additional shortcuts!</p>\n<p>‘Lite' copies pre-generated text and is the faster of the two options. 'Full' allows for setting parameters and generates brand new, unique text every time. 'Full' also gives users the option to generate HTML or plain text.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Full Version</strong>\n<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/6iA7BNC.png\"><img alt=\"Lorem Ipsum: Full\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6iA7BNC.png\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Using generated text in another shortcut by setting variable to shortcut input</strong>\n<img alt=\"https://i.imgur.com/GNI1LOg.png\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GNI1LOg.png\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Lite Version (As Input)</strong>\n<a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/sUxpPqkt_0A?feature=share\"><img alt=\"Lorem Ipsum: Lite (As Input)\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pOQbV2x.png\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Lite Version (Manual Entry/From Clipboard)</strong>\n<a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/N3Puq5bbx3c?feature=share\"><img alt=\"Lorem Ipsum: Lite (Manual Entry/From Clipboard)\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GLbhesJ.png\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Full Version (As Input)</strong>\n<a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/PC-AwNmM0t0?feature=share\"><img alt=\"Lorem Ipsum: Full (As Input)\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7JW7sMO.png\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Full Version (Manual Entry/From Clipboard)</strong>\n<a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/jJmomq7cVdE?feature=share\"><img alt=\"Lorem Ipsum: Full (Manual Entry/From Clipboard)\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sdjLNx3.png\"></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.0 - Sept. 30, 2021, 4:28 p.m.</strong></p>"}
