{"id":"634","name":"Alarms Creator","tagline":"Allows quick and easy creation of an alarm and accompanying alarms.","icon":"ios12 c3679049983 g59649","latest":"1327","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This shortcut was designed around the new ability to create alarms in the new Shortcuts update. I wanted to play with it and also, for my first time, dive into creating a more complex shortcut.</p>\n<p>What you can do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Create an alarm for any time, with any name (wait - that's easy though?)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add \"Extra\" alarms that accompany it before or after, with any number of extra alarms spaced however far apart you want. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why the extra alarms?</p>\n<p>I personally use it because I don't trust a single alarm to wake me up, and I bet many others don't either. Using this you can set up as many alarms as you want all in one easy process.</p>\n<p>Some quick notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a \".\" instead of \":\" when inputting time. This is due to the \"number\" input not having the option to use \":\" unfortunately (though it makes sense), and I really hate the \"wheel selector\" for times on iOS so I didn't use it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Usage Example:\nYou wish to wake up at 6:30am. Run the shortcut, type in \"6.30\" and then select AM. You can now also add extra alarms, let's say 2, and space them out by, let's say 5 minutes, and select that you want them after the base alarm. You now have alarms for 6:30am, 6:35am, and 6:40am. You won't sleep through that hopefully!</p>\n<p>Automatic updates powered by UpdateKit and RoutineHub.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.4 - Oct. 31, 2018, 5:08 p.m.</strong></p><p>Fixed usage for those whose regional settings use a \",\" instead of a \".\" for decimals.</p>"}
