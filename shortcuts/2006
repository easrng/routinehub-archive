So this shortcut is four you. You can mark the shortcuts you want as favorite and then it will provide you a list to run them quickly in the Shortcut app or even in the widget area!</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - Feb. 22, 2019, 12:06 p.m.</strong></p><p>New “add/delete fav shortcuts from list” and “reorder the fav list”.
