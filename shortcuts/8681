I've had less-than-great luck with scales that send weight automatically, and anyway, if I'm traveling won't have such a device with me. So I wrote this shortcut to easily enter my body weight from my Apple Watch. Not only does this log weight, but it calculates body mass index using height and weight and also logs that. Right now you must enter your height in manually in the first action (it is also an import question). I've tried getting that sample straight from Health, but though it works fine on my iPhone, fails on my Apple Watch. So, manual height entry into this shortcut it is for now. Luckily height doesn't change as often as weight.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - March 12, 2021, 3:21 a.m.</strong></p>"}
