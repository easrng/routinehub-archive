Your shortcut can be understood in almost any language using TranslateKit.</p>\n<p>Includes a built-in language picker with emoji country flags and translated language names.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Languages List\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ttnoOCu.jpg\"></p>\n<p>TranslateKit automatically detects the system language to localize the language picker and its menus. It puts the detected system language at the top of the language picker.</p>\n<h3>How-to add to your Shortcut</h3>\n<p>Getting started with TranslateKit is as easy as 2 actions.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Usage\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UAj1Jq9.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Run TranslateKit towards the beginning of your shortcut using a <strong>Run Shortcut</strong> action. Input a <strong>Dictionary</strong> action with <strong>shortcut_name</strong>, and <strong>shortcut_id</strong> keys. This will prompt the user to select a language to use for your shortcut. The <strong>Run Shortcut</strong> action will output the language they select. Keep in mind it will be in their system language.</p>\n<p>This sets up your Shortcut with TranslateKit.</p>\n<p>Duplicate those actions in your workflow but include a <strong>text</strong> key with a dictionary type value. Fill this dictionary with key value pairs.</p>\n<h4>Example:</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Key</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>MenuTitle</td>\n<td>Example Menu</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FirstMenuItem</td>\n<td>This is the first menu item</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SecondMenuItem</td>\n<td>This is the second menu item</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>When run, it returns a dictionary with the same keys, but with the values translated to the language the user selected.</p>\n<p>Refer to the full documentation for any further questions: <a href=\"https://translatekit.com/documentation\">https://translatekit.com/documentation</a></p>\n<h3>Dictionary Guide</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Key</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>shortcut_name <em>(Required)</em></td>\n<td>Text</td>\n<td>Name of your Shortcut</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>shortcut_id <em>(Required)</em></td>\n<td>Number</td>\n<td>Your shortcuts RoutineHub ID</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>text</td>\n<td>Text or Dictionary</td>\n<td>Standard text or dictionary to translate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>url</td>\n<td>URL</td>\n<td>JSON file URL such as ‘your_shortcut/file.json’. Method for inputting JSON from a file instead of a dictionary value. <strong>This path is prefixed with 'iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/' by Shortcuts.</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>progress</td>\n<td>Boolean</td>\n<td>Whether or not to show an alert before translating letting the user of your shortcut know that translating your shortcut may take a moment. This should only really be used if your shortcut will take longer than 30 seconds to translate.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>After translating the dictionary, the dictionary data is saved in iCloud as /translatekit/<strong>(your_shortcut_id)</strong>/translation.json.</p>\n<p>Translations are cached for quick retrieval so that if the text has not changed it won’t affect the speed of your shortcut. If it has changed, it will of course be translated again. If the input is already in the selected language, it is returned immediately.</p>\n<p>After the first run and cache, it’s just as fast as loading your own localizations except you didn't have to translate them!</p>\n<h3>Example shortcut</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Examples\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/muZJwy6.png\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2742\">Download Example \"How-to\" Shortcut on RoutineHub</a></p>\n<p>Download the example Shortcut for examples or troubleshooting your own Shortcut.

Translation speed or loading the cache can be slow as a result of a poor connection. The original text is returned immediately when offline.</p>\n<h3>Localization</h3>\n<p>TranslateKit detects the system language automatically to translate its internal menus, dialogues, and the names for languages. It does <strong>not</strong> use Mail, Calendars or Location Services to detect your system language.</p>\n<h3>Compatibility</h3>\n<p>TranslateKit uses the default <strong>Translate Text with Microsoft</strong> action to translate text and dictionaries to ensure compatibility. This of course means that language availability is limited by what the action supports.</p>\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Dependencies:</strong>\n<a href=\"http://www.mikebeas.com/updatekit/\">UpdateKit</a></p>\n<p>Powered by <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services\">Microsoft Cognitive Services</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911\"><img alt=\"Graphics created with MediaKit\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rej1rdt.png\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://scpl.dev/\"><img alt=\"Created with ScPL\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kHqoiAs.png\"></a>\nVersions after 2.1.3 are not created using ScPL.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.2.0 - May 12, 2021, 2:02 a.m.</strong></p><p>- Added previously missing localizations for Hebrew, Filipino, and Ukrainian<br>- Specifically corrected Filipino localization<br>- Updated username in GitHub URLs<br>- New menu item ‘Reset localizations &amp; flags’.
