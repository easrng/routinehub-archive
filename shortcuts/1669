{"id":"1669","name":"Cutshort","tagline":"Shortcut launcher that groups your Shortcuts together.","icon":"ios12 c4292093695 g59772","latest":"4618","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Runs best from main shortcuts screen. Don’t run from edit shortcuts screen</em></p>\n<p>Shortcuts doesn’t have folders. I use shortcuts of the same color with no visible name to visually group things together. It makes scrolling through long lists easy... put enough in a row and you can see those groups when scrolling fast. They kind of act like folders. I call them “pages”.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"shortcut image\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4zpT6Li.jpg\">\n<em>The Braille Pattern Blank Unicode character (U+2800) is used to name the Page break Shortcuts so they have no visible name.</em></p>\n<p>I created a Shortcut to find those invisible characters and display the shortcuts in each group... each page... together. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"shortcut image\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5bU6m8p.png\"></p>\n<p>Use a different character to identify page names and you can skip to a specific page...</p>\n<p><img alt=\"shortcuts page image\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qsR1XMX.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Select a shortcut and you’ll be given the option to Run or Edit it. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"shortcuts page image\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7BRmkpq.jpg\"></p>\n<p>The Edit option can automatically save a copy of the Shortcut before editing it. You’ll need to create a ‘Backups’ folder in ICloud Drive (Destination Path = Shortcuts/Backup). Change the ‘backup before editing’ setting to True after the folder is created to enable this feature. Otherwise leave as False and backups won’t be saved. </p>\n<p>Other random stuff...\n- There’s a search function available on every page. \n- Help creating shortcut names is available via the Page setup. </p>\n<p>Is this necessary for everyone? Probably not. I only have about 125 shortcuts (which isn’t a lot) but I still wanted better ways to group them. I was already using those empty shortcuts as page breaks so this worked for me. Maybe it will work for you too.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.01 - Jan. 19, 2019, 9:48 p.m.</strong></p><p>Big fix</p>"}
