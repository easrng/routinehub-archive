These shows don’t have podcasts, so I created this.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to run this shortcut: </p>\n<h1>Stand alone (Today's show only)</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Run the shortcut. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pick the show you want from the menu. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By default, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/filebrowser-document-manager/id364738545?mt=8Filebrowser\">FileBrowser - Document Manager by Stratospherix Ltd</a> will be launched if you have it. If you don't replace that with another file manager software that can play MP3s and extract a zip file. If you need help with another app, let me know and I will see if I can help.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you want to control this shortcut by voice commands, download <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1224\"><em>NPR by Voice</em></a> in addition to this shortcut.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>As a Share Shortcut</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From any web browser, go to any of the four NPR shows listed above for any day. (Eg. start at https://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/ and select something from the archive.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you find the show you want, select the Share symbol, pick Shortcuts and choose 'Download NPR'. This will automatically take the URL you are looking at and attempt to download the show. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h1>\n<p>This shortcut has an integrated update mechanism called  <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\">Embed-a-Update</a>. Thanks to the embedded updater, it does not require any external updater shortcut. The shortcut checks for updates itself, so you'll never miss an update and it is super fast. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cpBjhE3_d.webp?maxwidth=1000&amp;fidelity=large\"></a>\n</p><p></p><p></p>\n<p>If this Shortcut doesn’t work as expected, you have suggestions, or an idea to improve it, let me know!</p>\n<p>I also have a shell script version of this if you want to use it on macOS or Linux. https://gist.github.com/mbierman/6473119</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not associated with NPR in any way.
