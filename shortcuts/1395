Well with this Shortcut you can bring it back and so much more, you can also get directions and ETA’s to destinations. You can send a message to a contact to tell them when you’ll be arriving and can even lookup public addresses. You will need to select each app in “choose app” and obviously put the addresses in for home and work but the rest is simple.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>4 - Jan. 27, 2019, 4:04 p.m.</strong></p><p>Update to work with “going out” when sending messages.</p>"}
