I don't see myself repeating this if itâ€™s not necessary.</p>\n<p>Instead I did <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7923/\">my own framing shortcut</a> ðŸ™‚</p>\n<h4>Original description</h4>\n<p>This shortcut is a modified version of the \"Apple Frames\" shortcut by Federico Viticci. See his article \"<a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/ios/shortcuts-corner-apple-frames-for-iphone-12-and-se-get-image-resolution-encode-images-to-base64-and-search-articles-in-reeder/\">Shortcuts Corner: Apple Frames for iPhone 12 and SE, Get Image Resolution, Encode Images to Base64, and Search Articles in Reeder</a>\" (2020-10-30) for more information.</p>\n<p>The original shortcut had a size (11.1 MB) that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1322209496698114049\">apparently caused problems to some users</a>. I first <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atnbueno/status/1322292974848483329\">tried to help by optimizing the images to 2/3 of their original size</a> (7.2 MB) but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tmstr79/status/1322330238186115074\">it didn't work</a>, so I did this other version where the (now optimized) frames are in a zip file in iCloud Drive.</p>\n<p>I've put the <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/bitt1t06or6ibb6/Apple%20Frames.zip?dl=0\">optimized frames in my Dropbox</a>, and the shortcut will download them to <code>iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/Apple Frames.zip</code>. Other than this step, the replacement of the images, and a warning for unsupported sizes, the shortcut is unchanged, so all the merit is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci\">Viticci</a>'s.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Nov. 16, 2020, 11:31 p.m.</strong></p><p>Added a warning when a screenshot has an unsupported width (that screenshot is ignored, but at least the shortcut doesn't end with a nonsensical error message)</p>"}
