First, you'll need to create a new Shortcut on the RoutinePub website and set it to Published. Don't worry about adding a version right now â€” we'll do that in a second. For now, just click \"Continue in RoutinePub\" to see your shortcut's ID.</p>\n<p>Now all you need is the API Key listed on your <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/settings\" title=\"RoutineHub Settings\">RoutineHub account settings page</a> and you're ready to go!</p>\n<p>Once you've installed RoutinePub, you'll be prompted to add your API Key to the shortcut.</p>\n<p>After entering your API Key, you're all setup!</p>\n<h2>Delivering Updates to Users</h2>\n<p>If you want users of your shortcut to be able to get the latest version automatically, you can integrate the UpdateKit API into your shortcut. The UpdateKit API is an easy way to deliver shortcut updates to your users.</p>\n<p>You can find out more by <a href=\"http://www.mikebeas.com/updatekit-api\" title=\"UpdateKit\">visting the UpdateKit API website</a> and browsing the documentation.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>6.2 - May 13, 2022, 6:29 a.m.</strong></p><p>Changes the update flow so that RoutinePub is always up-to-date.

This is lightning fast now thanks to the new UpdateKit API.<br><br>Changes the display of some information, such as update release notes and the RoutineHub rules, to a different action because Apple has not fixed the broken Alert action on iOS 15 yet.</p>"}
