This shortcut can copy any amount of actions anywhere. It even saves them so you can paste them later again.</p>\n<p>This shortcut is the successor of my <em>CopyPaste Actions</em> workflow back in the days when Shortcuts was called <em>Workflow</em>.</p>\n<p>It should also work with iOS 13.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>cut, copy, paste and save any number of actions as <em>snippets</em></li>\n<li>smart handling of blocks like <code>If</code>, so your shortcuts won't get broken accidentally</li>\n<li>rich HTML user interface in Safari powered by JavaScript</li>\n<li>choose between iCloud Drive and Dropbox for storing preferences and snippets</li>\n<li>dark mode support</li>\n<li>marking of actions with comments and a very simple markup</li>\n<li>detailed help section</li>\n<li>fuzzy search for your shortcuts (it finds your shortcut, even if you've typed it wrong)</li>\n<li>quick mode: preselect any shortcuts to automatically process it whenever you run this shortcut</li>\n<li>inspect the copied actions</li>\n<li>automatic update check in the background</li>\n<li>available languages (please help me add more!)</li>\n<li>English</li>\n<li>German</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Screenshots</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshots from the shortcut\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dUMYKjV.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>Quick mode</h2>\n<p>Quick mode enables you to preselect any number of shortcuts that should be loaded and processed when you run this shortcut. There are multiple settings to control the level of quick mode.</p>\n<p>Because it is so quick, you actually have to confirm it, otherwise there would be no way to turn it off again.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"confirmation of quick mode\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/HPf6gqC.png\"></p>\n<h2>Screen recordings</h2>\n<h4>Default settings</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Oyew4glca7A\"><img alt=\"Showcase video\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tqyT17c.png\"></a></p>\n<h4>Quick mode</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4YRuQKeZD-M\"><img alt=\"quick mode video\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XPezNtQ.png\"></a></p>\n<h2>Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>I'm not responsible and cannot be held liable for any loss or damage in any way that results from the use or misuse of this shortcut.
