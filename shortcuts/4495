The results are far from spectacular, but the shortcut may be useful in a pinch.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d856cd43926e4a269c3fc998d93bd1e4\">Spanish version</a> is also available.</p>\n<p>(¹) Well, what do you know! Since releasing version 1.1.0 I've found out the system's printing dialog <em>can</em> be used to get non-contiguous pages.
