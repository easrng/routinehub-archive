This is the shortcut for you. Just enable Siri after a run and say “run Mario Kart Coin Counter” the shortcut will ask you how many coins you got on your last run. When prompted, tell Siri the number and she will repeat the number of coins, tell you your total for the day and let you know how many coins you have left for the day. \nThis shortcut automatically resets at 1:00 am local time. \n(Technically Mario Kart Tour isn’t required but the shortcut is fairly pointless without it)</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1 - Jan. 4, 2020, 3:28 p.m.</strong></p>"}
