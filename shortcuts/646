I tried to make everything as self-explanatory as possible. </p>\n<p>Scan a Barcode and enter the amount you consumed. Accordingly Dietary Energy, Carbohydrates, Total Fat and Protein will be logged to the Health App. If the barcode is not in your personal iCloud Food Database yet, openfoodfacts.org is searched. If no match is found or the data seems incorrect, you can enter the nutritional information by hand or choose a generic food.</p>\n<p>The Generic Food Tracker can be used for food without a barcode or full meals. This uses also a personal database that is empty at first, but grows with every generic food that is added.</p>\n<p>I have plenty of plans to add more features, like micronutrients tracking, meal prep tracking and a pantry store. Stay tuned!</p>\n<p>Feedback is always appreciated.
