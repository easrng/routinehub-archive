But it should work fine without it.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in launching shortcuts, keep reading:</p>\n<p>Listen Launcher is a shortcut launcher that is designed with the Siri interface in mind. Of course, Siri does a pretty great job at launching shortcuts already. But there are a few things we wish Siri would do better.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternative launch phrases</li>\n<li>Pass data to shortcuts</li>\n<li>Run multiple shortcuts from a single voice command</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Here is a demo of <strong>Listen Launcher</strong> launching two different shortcuts with a variety of phrases.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M05ZhOU0H4g\" title=\"Listen Launcher\"><img alt=\"Listen Launcher Demo\" src=\"https://edwardsdavid.com/dev/Shortcuts/Listen/promos/listen-video-promo2.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Note that one of the sample shortcuts -- Compliment -- can be downloaded on RoutineHub.</p>\n<p>Listen Launcher can do all of this and more because it is built on the <a href=\"http://compromise.cool\">nlp-compromise</a> Javascript library. This is how Listen Launcher knows about people, places, organizations, names, dates, values and dozens of other things.</p>\n<p>Listen Launcher consists of two shortcuts: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Listen Launcher Admin</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Listen does the listening and launching work, while Listen Launcher Admin is for configuration.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Once the shortcuts are installed, say: <strong>\"Hey Siri, listen\"</strong> to run the launcher.</p>\n<p>Out of the box, Listen Launcher knows phrases like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The names of your shortcuts</li>\n<li>\"in shortcuts\" -&gt;  Launch in the Shortcuts app</li>\n<li>\"Quit\" -&gt; Exit the chatbot</li>\n<li>\"show voice patterns\" -. View your saved patterns</li>\n<li>\"create voice pattern\" -&gt; Add a new voice pattern</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And if you forget the names of your shortcuts, don't worry. Listen Launcher will make suggestions based on your guess.</p>\n<p>Additional documentation is available in the two shortcuts.</p>\n<p>A third shortcut -- \"Compliment\" -- is <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3987\">available as an example</a> to play with and launch. Compliment comes with sample voice patterns that it can install.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Screens</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://edwardsdavid.com/dev/Shortcuts/Listen/promos/listen-screen_promo1.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://edwardsdavid.com/dev/Shortcuts/Listen/promos/listen-screen_promo2.jpg\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.1 - March 17, 2021, 3:47 p.m.</strong></p><p>*Fixed*<br>- Workaround for 9807 error</p>"}
