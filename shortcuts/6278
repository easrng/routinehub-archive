More reliable on younger kids or kids with less Siri Shortcuts knowledge or technology knowledge! This shortcut detects usage by setting volume/brightness to MAX, if kids play games in the night, the volume will wake parents, or if the volume is changed, it logs it into a Base64 Encoded File! This has not been tested for CPU usage, could cause long-term damage depending on device and device hardware status!</h6>\n<h3>(Use At Your Own Risk!
