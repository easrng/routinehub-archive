Currently, images that you want to use for the shortcut have to be saved to the Photos app to use the shortcut, as well as the output. Download my <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3832\">Toolbox Pro version to get a more appealing UI.</a> (future versions of my shortcut will not need tool box pro)</p>\n<p>The image on image feature is adjustable, allowing users to change which image comes first, as well as joining images horizontally or vertically.</p>\n<p>The shortcut can adjust images to your liking up to 100 times before needed to be saved (but the limit can be adjusted to be longer. I just put the limit as 100 as i thought it may make the shortcut slower. Also cause i thought no one is going to have to use it more then 100 times in one go.) </p>\n<p>Tested operating system: iPad OS and iOS 13.1</p>\n<p>Time taken to create this shortcut: 7 hours</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.4 - Oct. 4, 2019, 4:10 a.m.</strong></p><p>Actually fixed updates not working</p>"}
