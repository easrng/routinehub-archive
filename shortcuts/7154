With this shortcut, you are able to use Shazam It to identify and display your music in YTMusic. This was a request so I will continue to add features to both shortcuts simultaneously. This shortcut is designed with privacy in mind. All information is kept on your device and does not use external API's other than the apps themselves. This way you are not sending your information to potentially sketchy servers. I hope that people enjoy this. Have a great day.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.2 - Nov. 1, 2020, 2:02 a.m.</strong></p><p>An update feature has been added.<br>- Now the listing will show the year the album was released in the header when Shazaming the song.<br>- Minor update to replace text (utilized for accuracy in Shazaming locally).</p>"}
