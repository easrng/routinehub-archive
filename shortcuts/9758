(For example: <code>&lt;t:12345678:d&gt;</code>) By default, timestamps are displayed with the short date/time style, though several other style options are also available.</p>\n<p>For more information on how dynamic timestamps and other custom Markdown formats work on Discord, refer to Discord’s developer documentation: https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#message-formatting</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - July 28, 2021, 5:25 a.m.</strong></p><p>Replace “GMT” with the more technically correct “UTC” since UTC is a time standard rather than a time zone.</p>"}
