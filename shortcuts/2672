{"id":"2672","name":"Embed-a-Update","tagline":"The updater you don't have to install.","icon":"ios13 c946986751 g59849","latest":"11440","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Updated to iOS 13 by <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/user/ROP\">@ROP</a></p>\n<p>Embed-a-update is an updater like no other. Instead of requiring users download an extra shortcut to update yours, embed-a-update is embedded directly into your shortcut. </p>\n<h3>Why?</h3>\n<p>There are so many different updaters, all requiring people to download a different shortcut just to check for updates. Why not have an updater that doesn't require any downloads?</p>\n<p>Embed-a-Update is an updater that gets embedded inside your shortcut. When people run your shortcut, even if it's the only shortcut they have installed, it just works.</p>\n<p>Embed-a-update only takes 40 actions to use in your shortcut. This shortcut can be used to automatically add those actions.</p>\n<h3>How to use (For shortcuts built in the shortcuts app)</h3>\n<p>Add an action to your shortcut</p>\n<p><img alt=\"text description below\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jSPiaPD.png\"></p>\n<pre><code>Comment \"[[Embed-a-Here]]\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Run Embed-a-Update and choose your shortcut.</p>\n<p>Your shortcut now has Embed-a-update embedded in it. It is helpfully surrounded with a repeat action to make moving and removing it easier.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make a copy of your shortcut before running embed-a-update on it. While it shouldn't cause any problems, there is always a chance when editing .shortcut files that it could not work properly and damage your shortcut.</p>\n<p>Make sure to remove any previous Embed-a-Update related actions if you had any before running Embed-a-Update on your shortcut. Because Embed-a-Update hardcodes unique IDs, running twice might cause shortcuts to use the same ID twice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Customization</h3>\n<p>You can customize anything you want in Embed-a-Update. Show errors when the shortcut fails to update, force all users to update instead of giving a choice. You are not required to keep the [Eᴍʙᴇᴅ-ᴀ-Uᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ] label, feel free to remove it if you wish.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1.2 - Oct. 13, 2019, 6:43 p.m.</strong></p><p>New in version 1.1.2:<br>- Switch Github url</p>"}
