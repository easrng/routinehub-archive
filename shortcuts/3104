It uses your location and asks you for what row you parked in. It helps you make sure you never get your car lost again!</p>\n\n<h3>System requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Your system must have access to your iCloud Drive. To turn it on, go to Settings, iCloud (now your iCloud assigned name), and tap on iCloud Drive until the switch is green. You also need access to the internet about anywhere you go. This is because it will automatically track your location when saving a spot.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"DjProCredit\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cGML6qU.png\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3098\"><img alt=\"This Shortcut Supports Infinite Updater\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/6wNc6vj/06896986-3-C5-D-4-EB1-BD5-A-7078-B266-B664.png\"></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - July 4, 2019, 1:21 a.m.</strong></p><p>Bug fixes</p>"}
