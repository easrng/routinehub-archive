It's not recommended to store very sensitive information this way.</em></p>\n<h4>Shortcut actions:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Looks for a tokens.txt file in iCloud/Shortcuts</li>\n<li>If no file is present, it creates one and then loops to start again.</li>\n<li>Looks for an input from a shortcut first, which could be the ID of the token being requested.</li>\n<li>Checks the tokens.txt file for a value with the key of the ID being passed.</li>\n<li>If no such value is present, first it checks to see if the shortcut was passed an input and sets the ID based on that input</li>\n<li>If no input is present, such as when it's run on its own, shortcut will ask for a unique name</li>\n<li>Shortcut then asks for the token value, pasting in any value currently on the clipboard</li>\n<li>Shortcut then saves the file again with the new value</li>\n<li>The token value is passed as the output</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How to use within another shortcut:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a text action declaring the ID of the token you're looking to call</li>\n<li>Add a \"Run Shortcut\" action, using the recently created text action as its input. Note: it's best to let this shortcut run in the background.</li>\n<li>You can then use the output of this shortcut as your token value to call an API.</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Nov. 10, 2019, 1:36 p.m.</strong></p>"}
