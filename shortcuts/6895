I choose to run this Shortcuts when “Low Power Mode is turned off” so My phone appearance is set back to light or stay dark mode if it’s already night. \nYou can create other personal automations like “when phone is connected to power” to run this shortcut or other useful automations. </p>\n<p>This Shortcuts is very useful if you use to set your phone appearances to dark at night and to light at sunrise.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Oct. 9, 2020, 2:43 a.m.</strong></p>"}
