It’s nothing more than a collection of actions. For what? There are times when you need to reinstall the Shortcuts app—be it a corrupted database or some other problem with the Shortcuts app or iOS. If you reinstall the Shortcuts app, all your favorite actions will be lost. This shortcut should help you to add your favorites again in the easiest way possible. Please do not assume any witchcraft behind this shortcut. It simply contains the actions you see below in the order shown. It's the actions  and order I personally prefer. Of course it's up to you in which order you put your favorite actions. As usual, you have to add them to your favorites by tapping on the icon of the respective action. That's it.</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Favorite Actions Mockup\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MeyFhdU.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Exclusively available on RoutineHub.co\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VBSZY2Y.png\"></p>\n<p><em>This Shortcut is available exclusively on RoutineHub.co.
