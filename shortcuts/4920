Fortunately I found <a href=\"https://blog.timac.org/2018/1126-deobfuscated-libmobilegestalt-keys-ios-12/\">this fascinating blog post</a> by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/timacfr/\">/u/timacfr</a> where he deobfuscated most of them, so I decided to, based on that information, do this shortcut.</p>\n<p>The shortcut outputs a readable version of the <code>CacheExtra</code> key/dictionary in <code>com.apple.MobileGestalt.plist</code>, which contains interesting information about each device.</p>\n<p>A long time ago I did a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/9xzgyk/better_device_info/\">shortcut to get information about each device</a>, but it depended on JavaScript used for web tracking, so it stopped working when Apple brought the hammer down. Maybe it's time to resuscitate this old shortcut?</p>\n<h3>Binary data</h3>\n<p>Since version 1.2.0 the binary data in the dictionary is formatted as an hexadecimal string.</p>\n<h4>Before</h4>\n<pre><code>  \"MainScreenStaticInfo\": {\n    \"__type__\": \"data\",\n    \"__value__\": \"AAgAAKwKAAAIAQAAAAAAQNsPyT8LAAAA\"\n  },\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4>Now</h4>\n<pre><code>\"MainScreenStaticInfo\": \"00080000ac0a00000801000000000040db0fc93f0b000000\",\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This change makes easier to find some interesting data. For example, the <code>MainScreenStaticInfo</code> subkey above includes information about the screen of my <em>iPad Pro 12.9\"</em>: real width (<code>0x00000800</code> = 2048), real height (<code>0x00000aac</code> = 2732), and pixel density (<code>0x00000108</code> = 264)</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2.0 - Jan. 1, 2021, 1:19 p.m.</strong></p><p>JSON output is now formatted before being saved to iCloud Drive.
