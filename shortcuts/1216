Say you find a favorite pizza restaurant’s phone number on their website, or a coffee house in Google Maps, and you want to save the information to Contacts. Typically, you have to cut and paste. This is frustrating and inefficient.</p>\n<p>❇️ New! Now you can directly import an card from apps like Gmail. Just use the Share menu.</p>\n<p>This Shortcut makes it easy to save a Google Map search result or any other address/phone combination and makes it easy to add to your iOS contacts. You can create new contacts or add information to existing contacts.</p>\n<p>Phone numbers, email addresses, URLs are automatically parsed and placed correctly. In a tap, you can decide if a name, say, “Starbucks” is a person or a company. </p>\n<p>For now, only US Phone number formats are supported. I may expand that in the future.</p>\n<p>See the companion shortcut  <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3680\">Share Contact</a>.</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think. If it doesn't work as expected, let me know and I will see if I can fix it to meet your needs.</p>\n<h1>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h1>\n<p>This shortcut has an integrated update mechanism called  <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2672\">Embed-a-Update</a>.
