It includes some simple error checking. </p>\n<p>It will generate a 20 character password by default, but you can specify any length from 1-20. Entering anything over 20 will result in an error, as it is not supported by random.org.</p>\n<p>I like to use this in my widgets. Simply tap the shortcut, choose a length (or accept the default value of 20), note the resulting password, and choose \"Copy to clipboard\" if you like. It will vibrate if successful. </p>\n<p>If you receive a general error message you probably entered an invalid length, or the server is having unspecified trouble. Try a valid length or wait a few minutes and try again.</p>\n<p>A quota error means you exceeded the quota of randomness for your IP address.</p>\n<p>Not affiliated in any way with random.org. Feel free to modify for your own use.

It defaults to 20 so it's only one extra tap.</p>"}
