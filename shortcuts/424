They have similar functionalities in that they relate to how much time you have to leave or get to a destination (or how late you are). <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/422\">Where Next</a> provides driving directions to your next event, and Running Late messages who you're meeting that you're running late. Therefore, the text outputs are worded accordingly (and end with those different actions).</p>\n<p>Improvements/changes include:</p>\n<p>• allow fudge room time\n• look for events that have already begun a specified time ago as well as upcoming events\n• limit events found in other ways, such as no all-day events, ability to exclude particular calendars, etc.\n• more sensible contextual information, better wording, and more appropriate displays\n• configurable options (nudge time, minutes before to look, etc.)</p>\n<p>Screenshots:\n• <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/DBsMIfV.png\">Running Late - Not Late Yet</a>\n• <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/HqXHOD7.png\">Running Late - Gotta Leave Now</a>\n• <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/P1dnoYs.png\">Running Late - We're Running Late</a>\n• <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/oYWTyxp.png\">Running Late - Message</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:\nRunning Late - from the official Shortcuts Gallery</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.2 - Oct. 23, 2018, 4:07 p.m.</strong></p><p>Fixed some possible bugs</p>"}
