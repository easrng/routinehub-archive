This shortcut makes up for this oversight and lets you choose any equaliser preset from the existing ones. Additionally, you can adjust the volume without leaving the shortcut which is quite handy, especially after applying some equalisers that affect the volume or if you don't have \"Remote\" installed.  The shortcut will attempt to discern between \"iTunes\" and \"Music\" which is the default music player since macOS 10.15 \"Catalina\".</p>\n<p>On the very first run, this shortcut prompts the user to install another shortcut of my authorship, \"Remote Shell Command\" which is necessary for the silent logging into your remote Mac user account: this second shortcut is auxiliary and runs only once. Just follow the prompts which are self-explanatory.</p>\n<p>Feedback is welcome.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.04 - May 19, 2021, 2:08 p.m.</strong></p><p>Changed the link to the \"Remote Shell Command\" shortcut required for the setup of this shortcut. Existing users are strongly advised to update: the previous versions won't redirect to \"Remote Shell Command\" in the event that you lose it incidentally and then need to reinstall \"Choose iTunes/Music equalizer...\" or set it up anew because the link no longer exists. New users: download only from this version onwards.</p>"}
