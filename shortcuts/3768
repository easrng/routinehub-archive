Cyclists need to know not only what to wear on their ride to work but also potentially pack for a different condition on the way back.</p>\n<p>This shortcut uses Apple's default Weather App for data. It will tell you the current Weather Condition, Temperature, along with how that Temperature might feel like, the chance of Precipitation and \nHumidity for both ways on your commute. By default, its set to an 8-hour difference. Feel free to customize accordingly.</p>\n<p>I made a basic how-to for installing and getting the shortcut running. https://vimeo.com/371907555/5a7bd27a14</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Oct. 24, 2019, 3:52 p.m.</strong></p>"}
