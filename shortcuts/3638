I may, however, one day return with a full app to replace / realise Blind Diary once again. Personally, I'm currently using a folder in the notes app with an automation to create the diary page each afternoon.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Ever wanted to write a diary? Not exactly a fan of handwriting? And all the apps on the App Store either cost a fortune or are simply not fun to use? Don’t enjoy always seeing a wall of text of previous entries? Perhaps this shortcut can be a good alternative.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Blind Diary</strong> allows you to make new entries on the go, automatically adds date and time and saves them to a file.

Consider leaving a like on the RoutineHub page!<br><br>• Stats now Display average character, word, and sentence counts (Ø).<br>• Stats, Badges and (partially) Graphs now support going back to menu, and will display their content immediately if opening them again and being in the same session.<br>• Added more Information in case of a function error.<br>• You can now choose not to submit an entry.<br>• Removed debug function to recalculate Entries.txt as the feature is deprecated and no longer functional (and could potentially break your Settings.txt).<br>• Manual update menus now tell you why you see them.<br>• Fixed bug that would cause word count related achievements not to be announced when gained.<br>• Added 4 new beginner-related achievements, which are easy to get and introduce users to the various types of badges. If you have been using Blind Diary for any significant amount of time, you'll likely receive these achievements immediately (check them after submitting an entry or via the menu).<br>• Minor improvements</p>"}
