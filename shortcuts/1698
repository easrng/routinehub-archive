It will generate a grid of album art with an optional text overlay. Depending on how you configure it and how many albums are in the playlist it can generate up to an 7x7 grid (49 images).</p>\n<p>You can configure the shortcut to not prompt you for a text overlay, to use a specific grid size, and specify how you want to sort the album art.</p>\n<p>This shortcut also incorporates the <em>UpdateKit</em> shortcut so you can receive a notification to download a new version when I make updates to this shortcut.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Reddit user u/Syntask who came up with the idea and wrote this original shortcut. His code was excellent, but I wanted to add user-configurable options.
