This is very useful in assembling a sentence that includes a list for Siri to speak or to use in alerts and notifications.</p>\n<p>The text that is returned is based on how many items are passed to the shortcut:\n- If only one item of text is passed in, that string is returned, unaltered.\n- If two items of text are passed in, the two items are returned, separated by a space, the word “and”, and another space. For example, if “apple” and “orange” are passed in as an array, “apple and orange” is returned.\n- If three or more items of text are passed in, the items are separated by commas, except for the last two items, which are separated by a serial comma, a space, the word “and” and another space. For example, if “apple”, “orange”, and “banana” are passed in, “apple, orange, and banana” is returned.</p>\n<p>For those who don’t like serial commas, you can simply edit the Replace action to substitute “ and “ instead of “, and “.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Feb. 11, 2021, 11:35 p.m.</strong></p>"}
