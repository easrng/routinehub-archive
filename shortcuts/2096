It’s an alternative to the Control Centre with all the actions the regular one can do, but designed to work alongside it with so many more actions. It has anything from a built in game to a finance and budgeting feature built in--from a text spammer and delayed text message features to clearing water from your speakers and finding nearest fast food spots of your choice. Now with morning routine function!</p>\n<p>With full UpdateKit support, you’re always receiving new updates. You need another shortcut for this, available <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d972d46a34f240689a294de3a7e219cf\">here</a>. You can even save it to your home screen for even more functionality!</p>\n<p>There’s even a help, support, feedback, bugs, and suggestions submission feature where you can make submissions to help improve the app, or to get help and support. With the easy-to use interface you can see and know where everything is with ease, which isn’t always the case among other Control Centre alternatives.</p>\n<p>Credit:\nThanks to these guys for adding to my shortcut. \nThanks to these people for helping me make this, their contributions are listed:\n- Grorge-Download Cydia function-https://routinehub.co/user/Grorge\n- Ashortcut-Did UpdateKit for me-https://routinehub.co/user/AShortcuts</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>3.2 - March 9, 2019, 1:42 a.m.</strong></p><p>Fixed an issue with update</p>"}
