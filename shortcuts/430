{"id":"430","name":"Which Network","tagline":"Verbally announce which network you're connected to","icon":"ios12 c946986751 g59497","latest":"787","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The intent of this shortcut is to use Siri to verbally answer Which Network the device is connected to in a simple sentence. It will output the name of the wifi network, or else the name of the cellular carrier and whether or not there's a cellular internet connection.</p>\n<p>Note that the end contains both Show Result and Speak Text. This is due to an Apple bug on some older devices, and the work around was to use both.  If you find you're getting results twice, delete one of those steps. If that bug later gets fixed, I'll officially remove one. :)</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Oct. 23, 2018, 3:49 a.m.</strong></p><p>UpdateKit</p>"}
