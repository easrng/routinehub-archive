{"id":"12017","name":"M16A1","tagline":"Overcomplicated iMessage Spammer","icon":"ios14 c255 g59654","latest":"33240","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Ever wanted an over-complicated iMessage spammer?</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p><strong>Requires libM16A1: <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12016/\">https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12016/</a></strong></p>\n<p>M16A1 is an iMessage spammer with functions based off of operating an M16A1. It has features such as a firemode selector switch, bolt catch, and forward assist. </p>\n<p>Operating the shortcut is analogous to operating an M16A1. Each time you have the option to manipulate features of the shortcut (pull charging handle, etc.), you will be presented with an image of an M16A1 in its current state, then a list of functions to choose from. More on that later.</p>\n<p>To \"load\" the shortcut, have a text file with the text you want to spam. The shortcut will split apart the text word by word and send each one as a separate message to your target phone number.</p>\n<p>If gaming or other experiences have trained you to use an M16A1, feel free to try out the functions by yourself. You can \"load\" the shortcut by selecting a text file after using the <code>Load Magazine</code> option. If you want to learn how to use the shortcut, read on. There is an example at the bottom of the description.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Functions</h2>\n<p><strong>Pull Trigger:</strong></p>\n<p>Analogous to pulling the trigger of an M16A1. If your selector lever is set to semi or auto and you have a text file \"chambered\", then this will send the message to your target.</p>\n<p><strong>Pull Charging Handle Back:</strong></p>\n<p>Analogous to pulling the charging handle of an M16A1 back. In real life, this chambers a round from the magazine. In the shortcut, this \"chambers\" the first word in your text file, which makes it ready to send. </p>\n<p>However, if the M16A1 is already chambered (bolt closed), then pulling the charging handle will eject the round currently in the chamber. Similarly, if the shortcut is already \"chambered\", then pulling the charging handle will skip the currently \"chambered\" word and move on to the next one.</p>\n<p><strong>Depress Bolt Catch:</strong></p>\n<p>Analogous to pushing the bolt catch button on an M16A1. In real life, pressing the bolt catch on an open bolt will close it, simultaneously chambering a round if there is a magazine loaded. In the shortcut, this is used to close an open bolt, which also \"chambers\" a word. Pressing the bolt catch on a closed bolt does nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>Push Forward Assist:</strong></p>\n<p>Does the same thing as the bolt catch.</p>\n<p><strong>Move Selector Lever:</strong></p>\n<p>Analogous to moving the selector lever of an M16A1. The M16A1 features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Safe</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Semi (Semi Automatic)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Auto (Fully Automatic)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Semi auto is when you pull the trigger once, and one  round is fired. Full auto is when you hold down the trigger, and multiple rounds are fired in succession. </p>\n<p>In the shortcut, \"semi\" will send one message per trigger pull, and \"auto\" will send all the words in your text file.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind the selector lever's default is in the \"safe\" position. You need to change it to send messages.</p>\n<p><strong>Load Magazine:</strong></p>\n<p>Analogous to loading a magazine into an M16A1. Magazines are where rounds are stored and for the shortcut, it is where the words are stored. Loading the magazine in this shortcut involves selecting a text file.  The shortcut then reads the text file and splits it by word. These words are analogous to individual rounds, and can be sent to your target.</p>\n<p><strong>Unload Magazine:</strong></p>\n<p>Analogous to unloading a magazine into an M16A1. By removing the magazine, there won't be a round to chamber once you fire what is currently in the chamber. However, removing a magazine does not always mean \"unchambering\". As per standard gun safety, make sure the chamber is clear if you don't intend to continue using.</p>\n<p><strong>Check Chamber and Bolt:</strong></p>\n<p>This allows you to check what position the bolt is in, and whether a round is currently chambered.</p>\n<p>Open means that the bolt is locked back. This happens after completely firing through a magazine. When this happens, you need to unload the magazine, then load a new one, then either pull the charging handle or depress the bolt catch.</p>\n<p>Closed means that the bolt is currently closed and chances are that there's a round in the chamber. If you pull the charging handle here, it will eject the currently \"chambered\" word. Depressing the bolt catch does nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>Check Selector Lever:</strong></p>\n<p>This allows you to see what position the selector lever is currently in. Refer to the above description for the selector lever if you need to make changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Check Magazine</strong></p>\n<p>This allows you to see if there is currently a \"magazine\" or text file loaded by the shortcut.</p>\n<p><strong>Exit Shortcut</strong></p>\n<p>Exits shortcut.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Example:</h2>\n<p>This is an example of how to use the shortcut. It will fire through two magazines (text files)</p>\n<p>1) Load Magazine</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will be asked to select a text file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2) Pull Charging Handle Back</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This \"chambers\" a word, making it ready to fire.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3) Move Selector Lever</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Here, let's use the \"auto\" setting. If you skip this step, pulling the trigger later on won't do anything because you will still be in the \"safe\" position.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>4) Pull Trigger</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since the \"auto\" setting was used, all the words in the text file are sent out.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>5) Unload Magazine</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You need to manually unload empty mags.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>6) Load Magazine</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Let's load a second text file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>7) Depress Bolt Catch</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Notice that here, depressing the bolt catch works because the bolt was locked in the open position after the magazine was fully depleted. You could have also pulled the charging handle to \"chamber\" a new word.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>8) Pull Trigger</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The \"auto\" setting has not changed, so it now empties the new magazine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>9) Unload Magazine (optional)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You need to manually unload empty mags.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>10) Check Chamber and Bolt (optional)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In real life, please exercise gun safety when handling any guns. Before storing a weapon, you'd really want to check the chamber.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>11) Pull Charging Handle (optional)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Again, just to make sure your gun is really clear, pull the charging handle to eject any possibly chambered rounds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>12) Move Selector Lever (optional)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Move it to the \"safe\" setting. Just so in the future, you don't accidentally load your gun, pull the trigger on accident, and put a hole in your foot.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>13) Exit Shortcut</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exits the shortcut.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anywhere in the shortcut, you could use the functions that start with <code>Check...</code> in order to check the status of that part of the shortcut. For beginners who just want to get a hang of what function changes what, it is beneficial to check bolt and selector levers frequently.</p>\n<p>Enjoy?</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - May 26, 2022, 3:12 a.m.</strong></p>"}
