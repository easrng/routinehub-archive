You can either choose to watch the microwave or hear the microwave, but there’s a little surprise at the end!</p>\n<p>When the shortcut finishes playing the microwave, it will ask you if you would like to exit the shortcut— but there’s a catch. Upon clicking “Yes”, the shortcut will flashbang you by playing the CSGO flashbang sound effect and turn your brightness up all the way while enabling light mode. After that, the shortcut will begin to spam you with notifications and then (safely!) freeze and crash your device (respring).</p>\n<p>This shortcut would be a great prank for you friends! Enjoy :D</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Nov. 10, 2020, 9:05 p.m.</strong></p>"}
