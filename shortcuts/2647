QuickUpdate is the One of the <strong>Fastest</strong> Updaters on RoutineHub. This Updater has a lot of features that you expect in a premium updater, with blazing fast speed! The main purpose of QuickUpdate is to balance <strong>speed and features</strong>, so your users can enjoy world-class features, while also enjoying lightning speed!</p>\n<h2>Amazing Features:</h2>\n\n<h3>Easy to Embed</h3>\n\n<p>QuickUpdate is super easy to Embed into your shortcut. Just get <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4362\">QuickUpdate: Integrated Edition!</a>\n</p><h3>Easy to Combine</h3>\nQuickUpdate uses the same dictionary that Update Checker 2.0 uses, therefore, it’s very easy to use Update Checker 2.0 and QuickUpdate for your shortcut, as you can use the same dictionary.\n<h3>Multiple Languages</h3>\nYou want your shortcut to be suitable for everyone. That’s why QuickUpdate has support for Multiple Languages!<p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5322\">German Version</a> Translated by ROP</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5323\">Portugal Version</a> ( Translated by D3W10)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5324\">Italian Version</a> (Translated by alombi)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>If you would like to translate QuickUpdate to a currently not available language, DM @QuickUpdate5 to participate in the zachary7829 Translation Program.</strong>\n</p><h3>Choice</h3>\nSometimes, users want to install updates later. That’s why QuickUpdate lets users choose whether they want to update or not.\n<h3>Offline Mode</h3>\nIf you’re offline, you still want to use your all of your shortcuts. That’s why QuickUpdate has an “Offline Mode,” where instead of your shortcut stopping if the user is offline, the shortcut will continue.\n<h3>Tap To Check For Updates</h3>\nNot only will QuickUpdate check for updates for your shortcut, but it will also check for updates for itself when you tap on it. This not only means that the user can decide when they want to check for any updates to QuickUpdate instead of constantly checking and taking up boot time, but also means that your user’s boot times will be kept optimized on the newest methods.\n<h3>Multi-Decimal Support</h3>\nYou want to be able to have multiple decimals in your version, such as 2.2.2. That’s why QuickUpdate is one of the <strong>fastest</strong> Updaters with <strong>Multi-Decimal support.</strong>\n<h3>Worded Version Support</h3>\nYou want the ability to have worded versions, such as “2.0 Beta”, “4.0 Aqua Edition.”, or even just “Cake Edition”. That’s why QuickUpdate has support for <strong>fully worded versions</strong>, which means you can call your version whatever you would like! (Note: Requires QuickUpdate 2.2 or higher).\n<h3>Support For One, Support For All.</h3>\nBy adding QuickUpdate support to your shortcut, you not only allow your users to choose between the already world-class QuickUpdate, but also the speed-focused QuickUpdateEX, and the extremely optimized feature-focused UltraUpdate.\n<h3>A Gorgeous vCard User Interface</h3>\nYou want a useful, and pretty user interface. That’s why QuickUpdate &amp; UltraUpdate both have user interfaces made with vCards, making an absolutely <strong>Gorgeous</strong> user interface.\n<h3>Highly Downloaded</h3>\nQuickUpdate already has <strong>10.0K downloads</strong> on RoutineHub, so you don’t have to worry about your users not having it.\n<h3>High Shortcut to Updater Download Ratio</h3>\nQuickUpdate has the highest shortcut to Updater download ratio on RoutineHub. What this means is that some users don’t want to download an Updater when they use a shortcut; so, they don’t use the shortcut that requires an Updater. This can negatively impact your downloads. However, (according to data I collected) when users often download a shortcut that requires QuickUpdate, about 5/6 times they either install QuickUpdate, or have QuickUpdate already installed. So, don’t worry about your downloads being affected. (Please note that this data only includes Updaters on RoutineHub)\n<h3>Links to RoutineHub Page.</h3>\nAlmost all updaters that update a shortcut directly from the download page (except Swing Updater, due to it using routinehub.co/download) take your users directly to the iCloud URL. This is bad, because then your shortcut will get less downloads, and have less chance to get on Trending, both giving your shortcut less recognition. However, QuickUpdate links to your Shortcut’s RoutineHub page, so not only can they check out what is different about the update, but you can also get more downloads.\n<h3>iOS 13 &amp; iOS 14 support!</h3>\nQuickUpdate 2.0 and up supports <strong>iOS 12, 13, and 14!</strong> So, no matter what iOS version you’re on, you can enjoy QuickUpdate’s speed and features!\n<h3>Supports down to Shortcuts 2.0.0!</h3>\nQuickUpdate supports all versions of the Shortcuts app down to 2.0.0! QuickUpdate is one of the <strong>only</strong> updaters that support all the way down to 2.0.0, and is the <strong>only</strong> Updater that still gets updates for Shortcuts 2.0.0!\n<h3>Siri Support</h3>\nUnless there’s an update available, QuickUpdate does not go into the shortcuts app when called from Siri!\n<h3>Semi-Rollback Support</h3>\nQuickUpdate will detect rollbacks! However, please be aware that QuickUpdate does not distinguish them from normal updates.\n<h3>RoutineHub &amp; ShareShortcuts Support</h3>\nQuickUpdate supports both RoutineHub &amp; ShareShortcuts! If you want to use the ShareShortcuts Edition: https://shareshortcuts.com/shortcuts/744-quickupdate-ss-edition.html\n<h3>Secure</h3>\nQuickUpdate does not allow for Custom URLs. This means a malicious shortcut cannot take advantage of this and force QuickUpdate to do things such as collect your IP address.\n<h3>0Masking</h3>\nQuickUpdate 2.2 and up 0Masks the version, fixing some auto-formatting issues with the Shortcuts app. This means that QuickUpdate should be even <strong>more stable than Updaters with Update Engines.</strong>\n<h3>Uses HTTPS</h3>\nUnlike some other updaters, the latest version of QuickUpdate forces Safari to visit RoutineHub through HTTPS, instead of unencrypted HTTP.\n<h3>Supports UltraUpdate’s CFU Engine</h3>\nQuickUpdate supports UltraUpdate’s CFU Engine. This means that any shortcut you update via QuickUpdate, you can check for updates using UltraUpdate!\n<h3>Very easy to switch to.</h3>\nQuickUpdate is very easy to switch to from another updater. In fact, using RouteUpdate, you can switch and never have to worry about modifying developer’s shortcuts to add support!\n<h3>Want to Skip an update? Skip it.</h3>\nQuickUpdate has an option to skip updates. That means if you don’t like an update, you can just skip it!\n<h3>Easy Implementation</h3>\nQuickUpdate is very easy to implement. Down below is how to do it!\n<img alt=\"QuickUpdate\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fHBCyx2.jpg\"><p></p>\n<h3>Badge</h3>\n\n<p>QuickUpdate has a Download badge, which you can put in to your description. Just copy this text over and your description should have the badge!</p>\n<h4>Large Badge:</h4>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>[![This Shortcut Requires QuickUpdate - Tap To Download!](https://i.imgur.com/7aYMAD3.png)](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2647)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Badge Version: 2)\n</p><h4>Recommenced Badge:</h4><p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[![This Shortcut Requires QuickUpdate - Tap To Download!](https://i.imgur.com/QKzlHwT.png)](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2647)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Q/A:</h2>\n\n<h5>By looking at QuickUpdate’s actions, I was able to optimize my Updater.</h5>\n\n<p>That’s Great! Just give credit to QuickUpdate for help on Optimizing your Updater.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>Does QuickUpdate have support for Multi-Decimal in older versions?</h5>\n\n<p>The oldest version that has Multi-Decimal is 1.4. Every version older than 1.4 does not support Multi-Decimal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>Does QuickUpdate have support for Worded Versions in older versions?</h5>\n\n<p>The oldest version that has Fully-Worded Version support is 2.2. Versions 1.4-2.1 only have support for Semi-Worded Versions, meaning the version would need to have a number as the first character, and the rest can be worded.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n</p><h5>I get an error saying that an update is available even though one isn’t.</h5>\nIf you have a version number that hasn’t released yet on RoutineHub, such as you give your Dictionary 1.8 but the latest on RoutineHub is 1.7, it will detect an update.<p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n</p><h5>What iOS version is QuickUpdate for?</h5>\niOS 12, 13, 14, and 15! And soon, it will support Workflow as well, meaning you can get support for iOS 9-15, making it the updater supporting the <strong>most iOS versions!</strong><p></p>\n<p>(Note: iOS 12 support is only present in versions 3.1 and below.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n</p><h3>Shortcuts Supporting zachary7829 Updaters:</h3><p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2502\">Screenshot Corrupter</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3458\">Better LPM</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2648\">The Oregon Trail</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2935\">Omega Power Mode</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2235\">Ultra Low Power Mode</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3455\">Quick Low Power Mode</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4926\">Battery Saver Plus</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2579\">Super Respring</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3625\">bitin</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2579\">Tree Installer</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4141\">iOS Themes</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3188\">Download System Files</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3309\">MyControlCenter</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2928\">QuickTranslate</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2758\">FFORDR</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4394\">vCard Utilities</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3163\">QuickSearch</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1731\">iUtilities</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5116\">Shortcuts User Guide</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4614\">Widget Weather</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4961\">Jailbreak iOS 13.0-13.3</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5167\">Turnip Tracker for ACNH</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n(P.S.: If your shortcut supports a zachary7829 updater and isn’t on here, tweet at @QuickUpdate5 and I’ll add it to the list!)\n&nbsp;\n</p><h4>Credits</h4>\nQuickUpdate: by @zachary7829\n&nbsp;<p></p>\n<p>1.6/1.7/1.8 User Interface based of <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1118\">Update Checker 2.0</a> by <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/user/AShortcuts\">@AShortcuts</a>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/user/pfg\">@pfg</a>, as my first ever Update Checker was based off of <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/793\">Check For Updates.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/user/rop\">@ROP</a>, as the first ever Badge for QuickUpdate was made with <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911\">MediaKit</a>, and he translated QuickUpdate to German!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/user/D3W10\">@D3W10</a> for translating QuickUpdate into Portugal</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/user/alombi\">@alombi</a> for translating QuickUpdate into Italian\n</p><h3>Compared to other zachary7829 updaters:</h3>\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;<p></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Updater</th>\n<th>Actions</th>\n<th>Multi-Decimal</th>\n<th>Worded Versions</th>\n<th>Offline Mode</th>\n<th>Self-Updating</th>\n<th>User-Interface</th>\n<th>Frequent Updates</th>\n<th>CFU Engine Support</th>\n<th>Integrated</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>QuickUpdateEX</td>\n<td>5 Actions</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Nope</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>QuickUpdate</td>\n<td>20 Actions</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>When Tapped</td>\n<td>UI made with vCards</td>\n<td>Yes!</td>\n<td>Yes (Auto-Supports UltraUpdate)</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UltraUpdate</td>\n<td>142 Actions</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Automatic</td>\n<td>UI made with vCards</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Not Yet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>QuickUpdate: Integrated Edition</td>\n<td>25 Actions</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>UI made with vCards</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes (Auto-Supports UltraUpdate and SFU)</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thanks so much for 10,000 downloads! ^_^</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>3.4 - July 18, 2022, 5:18 a.m.</strong></p><p>Re-Added support for iOS 12 (and Workflow for iOS 8.0+ users) while retaining the same support for iOS 13/14/15/16.</p>"}
