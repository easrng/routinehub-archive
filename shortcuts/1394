Many test-prep programs provide a tally of progress, but I found it cumbersome to have to go to the right place on their website every time I was curious about my progress, and then have to repeat that process for each QBank.</p>\n<p>Enter Question Bank Question Counter! Originally made to prepare for my COMLEX exam, this shortcut can be used for any test preparation and gives you a 1-tap access to your running tally, tells you how many questions you have left before you reach your goal, gives you your daily total, and intelligently calculates the daily average needed to reach your goal by a certain date. Updating info is easy, and convenient menu options allow for error corrections in case you type in a wrong number by mistake.</p>\n<h1>It’s as easy as 1-2-3!</h1>\n\n<p>With one tap, you can see your daily summary, a breakdown of your overall progress, and precisely enter in your progress for the day in the qbank of your choice.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"In app\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XXTPOGX.jpg\"></p>\n<h1>Record progress from anywhere!</h1>\n\n<p>It also works with widgets on iOS. Now you can record your questions from anywhere!</p>\n<p><i>To turn on the widget, go to the left of the home screen, scroll all the way down, tap “edit”, then tap the green “+” button next to “shortcuts.”</i></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Widget\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/hiT8BL7.jpg\"></p>\n<h1>Track your progress overtime!</h1>\n\n<p>The new “Question Log” feature allows you to record how many questions you did on a certain day, from which QBank you did them, and how well you did. <i>Numbers are for demo purposes, and are not my actual stats</i></p>\n<p><i>Requires “<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2145\">UI Library</a>” by @entee.</i></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Question Log\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8g2wHd0.png\"></p>\n<h1>Customize which QBanks you want to use!</h1>\n\n<p>Now you can choose up to 4 question banks that you wish to record your counts for, making this tool accessible even for students preparing for other exams! QBanks are chosen upon setup and can be changed later through a convenient menu option</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Custom banks\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/o8y0qqL.jpg\"></p>\n<hr>\n\n<p><img alt=\"New to shortcuts\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GtD3RkE.jpg\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mikebeas.com/updatekit/\"><img alt=\"UpdateKit\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3QMzlEV.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911\"><img alt=\"Mediakit\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QqGq3Uu.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Made by\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pi013nc.jpg\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>4.3 - March 2, 2020, 2:46 p.m.</strong></p><p>Brought the shortcut to iOS 13. Don’t update if you are running a lower firmware! Now you can disable the calculation of the overall average. This will enable faster startups. This version, as opposed to the Deluxe version, is perfect for updating qcounts from the widgets.</p>"}
