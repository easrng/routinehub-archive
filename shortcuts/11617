It works for all apps that support a share sheet, but if an app doesnâ€™t, you can set up a voice command or have the thumbnail in a convenient place to use this.</p>\n<p>Discord users @rocky5 and @elroysgame spent a couple hours working out the kinks in this shortcut.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - April 19, 2022, 4:50 a.m.</strong></p>"}
