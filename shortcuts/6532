It is designed to play a sound with an ultra low 165Hz frequency that apparently helps eject sound from the speaker cavity of your iDevice.*</p>\n<h4>How it works</h4>\n<p>Simply run the shortcut and it will play the water eject sound. Nothing else required</p>\n<h4>Why use Water Eject Ultra Light?</h4>\n<p>Certain other Water Eject shortcuts require upward of 100 actions to achieve the same results that Water Eject Ultra Light achieves in three actions. There is no filler here, just activate and play your water ejection.</p>\n<p>Water Eject Ultra Light is compatible with both iOS 13 and 14 and all versions of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch those operating systems.</p>\n<p>* Disclaimer: I have no idea if the water eject sound really works and most modern phones are already water resistant and don't need a water eject shortcut. However, this uses the same sound as other water eject shortcuts. So if you want a water eject shortcut that works great with less filling, I recommend Water Eject Ultra Light.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Sept. 17, 2020, 7:30 p.m.</strong></p><p>Initial Release of this Ultra Awesome shortcut</p>"}
