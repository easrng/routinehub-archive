Only the image on image feature uses Toolbox pro. Internet connection is only used for updating the shortcut.</p>\n<p>This simple meme generator/maker that allows you to put text on images and join images together. Currently, images that you want to use for the shortcut have to be saved to the Photos app to use the shortcut, as well as the output. Or input can be from any image that is activated through the share sheet. Other implementations are currently being developed</p>\n<p>The image on image feature is adjustable, allowing users to change which image comes first, as well as joining images horizontally or vertically.</p>\n<p>The shortcut can adjust images to your liking up to 100 times before needing to be saved (but the limit can be adjusted to be longer. I just put the limit as 100 as I thought it may make the shortcut slower. Also, cause I thought no one is going to have to use it more than 100 times in one go.)
