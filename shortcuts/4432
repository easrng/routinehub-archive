I built it just for fun and for personal use. It is NOT an official product.</p>\n<p>You can choose from seven different news shows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tagesschau</li>\n<li>Tagesschau in 100 Sekunden</li>\n<li>Tagesthemen</li>\n<li>ZDF heute</li>\n<li>ZDF heute journal</li>\n<li>ZDF heute Xpress</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Upon installation the shortcut asks for your desired target device where you want to watch. Besides watching on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch it's possible to choose your <strong>Apple TV</strong> here as well! In this case your iOS device will AirPlay the episode to your Apple TV automatically.</p>\n<p>Of course you can change your decisions later by editing the Shortcut. You might build an automation, e.g. NFC-triggered which just runs this shortcut. You can also use a Siri phrase to run it. Since iOS 13 Siri is using the name of the shortcut for that. So you could rename it and say: „Hey Siri, play the german news“! </p>\n<p><strong>Preview:</strong></p>\n<p>Screenshot:\n<img alt=\"screenshot\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/SsfHuBe.jpg\"></p><p></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.1 - Feb. 15, 2021, 1:45 p.m.</strong></p><p>Bugfix iOS 14</p>"}
