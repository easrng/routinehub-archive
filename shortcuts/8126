DO NOT TRY ON IPHONES</p>\n<p>Tested on iPad 5th generation on iOS 13.6</p>\n<p>Uses the command iofbres from the tweak System Info from ARX8x's repo to change resolutions of iPads. Resolutions are taken from this article: https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ipads-screen-resolution-ips-display-1994325</p>\n<p>Meant to allow for upscaling/downscaling of screen resolutions. This can allow for more content to be displayed, an example being the iPad 12.9's resolution used on a 10.5 inch iPad.</p>\n<p>Do not manually put in your own resolutions unless you know what you are doing. </p>\n<p>The 'Reset' option is \"iofbres r\".</p>\n<p>This shortcut uses ssh, so you need to know what port and root password to use. Checkra1n uses port 44, other jailbreaks use port 22 or 2222.</p>\n<p>If you encounter a black screen that does not respond, DO NOT REBOOT. Use a device to ssh into the device and enter the command 'iofbres r'</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.6 - Jan. 17, 2021, 11:41 p.m.</strong></p><p>Fix text</p>"}
