The images will be sent to Listify which will format them into a pretty list and return the list to your shortcut. Then simply place a <em>Choose from List</em> action below the call to Listify and you‚Äôre done.</p>\n<p>If you would prefer to not have the border that Listify overlays on your images, simply include the word <code>(noframe)</code> in parenthesis at the end of the image‚Äôs Set Name. </p>\n<p>At the bottom of this page you can download an Example Shortcut which will demonstrate Listify in action.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>How it Works</strong></p>\n<p>I was frustrated with Shortcut's inability to create Choose from List menus that could contain images as well as information, and discovered (at least for myself) a clever way of getting around the limitation.</p>\n<p>Previously, I'd found that if I passed a dictionary to a Choose from List, I could get a <em>Title</em> text and a <em>Subtitle</em> text by reading the dictionary's Key for the top line, and Value for the second line. This is great but doesn't give me images.</p>\n<p>One solution I'd seen was to create a list that included both images as well as some other type of item like a Text item, and using the Set Name action on the images which would then show next to the image as a Title. The downside of this is that these lists always include the word \"Image\" below the Title, and the secondary item required in those lists would say \"Text\". Not pretty.</p>\n<p>Eventually I discovered that one type of list item that would give me all I wanted was a list of <strong>Contacts</strong>. vCards can contain an image file, and the person's Name would show up on one line, and their Company if specified would show up underneath.</p>\n<p>I opened up a vCard in a text editor, found them to be quite simple to create from blank text that specifies a \"person's\" Name, Company and Photo (in base64), and voila, I could now generate Contacts on the fly, pass them into a Choose from List action, and then read whatever information I wanted from the chosen item for the rest of my workflow.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>I used this method for my list-heavy bill management shortcut\n <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1024\">‚Çøùïöùïùùïùùï™</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of_dlD-ZFVw\">Demo</a>, so feel free to check that out if you'd like.</strong></p>\n<p>I've also created a simple <strong><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7901c3f9e4244d8fb21d883174cc4b5f\">Example Shortcut</a></strong> which you can download alongside Listify. With it, you can specify some images (preferably square), and get back a pretty list from Listify.
