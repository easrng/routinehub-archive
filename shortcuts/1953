Once all tests pass, you have beaten the challenge.</p>\n<h3>Shortcut Golf Rules</h3>\n<p>Your goal is to beat the challenge in as few actions as possible. There are some limitations on what actions you can use to make sure you actually code a solution.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not use actions that leave the shortcuts app, get user input, load online resources, or are 3rd party.</li>\n<li>Your solution should work with any valid input, even if it isn't a test case. Do not just hardcode input/output pairs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>More Info</h3>\n<p><strong>View Details</strong>: See information about the challenge including the goal of the challenge and how to beat it.
