Coming in v2.0.0","icon":"ios13 c4282601983 g59767","latest":"13114","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><img alt=\"UpdateR\" src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/933302115940589621/933302242570797076/banner.png?width=1080&amp;height=506\"></p>\n<p>UpdateR is an updater for all shortcuts currently on RoutineHub. It is extremely easy to integrate with all existing shortcuts on RoutineHub.</p>\n\n<p><b>v2.0.0 Process Update 1:</b> An engine has been finished to replace the simple update checking system for higher stability and speed. A shortcut UI has also been partially completed and the skip update function is being optimised for v2.0.0. A “Check For Updates” function is planned however not started. Multiple decimal support has also been implemented as part of the update engine. Currently, implementing support for worded versions is planned for in the future, preferably v2.0.0.</p>\n\n<p><b>v2.0.0 Progress Update 2:</b> iOS 15 Shortcuts is literally an eyesore to use. Laggy interface, crashing everywhere, and being unable to drag blocks into an area. Constant “There was a problem” errors are persistent in the BETA UpdateR version. Due to this, v2.0.0 will be heavily delayed. Pls fix, Apple. I am also planning to upload the beta version soon, so stay tuned!”</p>\n\n<h3>Dictionary Layout</h3>\n\n<p>Shortcut Name - Text: The shortcut name in RoutineHub</p>\n\n<p>Version - Text: Current Version of shortcut</p>\n\n<p>RHID - Text: RoutineHub ID</p>\n\n<p>AutoR - Boolean: A true boolean will turn off the notification for no new versions</p>\n\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n\n<p>UpdateR is undeniably quick and well-performing. As of version 1.0, it will only cover the very basics of an updater, only containing 26 actions. This amount may grow to allow for more functions. Future plans may also include having a “skip update” function, shortcut user interface, and a program similar to “Check For Updates”.</p>\n\n<h3>Badge</h3>\n\n<p>Please insert this badge into your UpdateR supporting shortcuts.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4076\"><img alt=\"UpdateR Certification Badge\" src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/933302115940589621/933302242918928454/UpdateR_Badge.png\"></a></p>\n<blockquote>[![UpdateR Certification Badge](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/933302115940589621/933302242918928454/UpdateR_Badge.png)](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4076)</blockquote>\n\n<p>Customised badges may be used as long as the name \"UpdateR\" is clearly stated (no alternative spellings), contains \"This is supported by\" or equivalent, contains at the footer \"Licensed by @DjPro - RoutineHub - Custom badge by (Your Name Here)\", and has the icon.
