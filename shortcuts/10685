Modeled after the 'git diff' command found in Git version control systems, sc diff shows the changes between two versions of a shortcut. This can be helpful during the debugging process and can help find changes that broke a shortcut such as moving or changing actions, deleting actions, and adding new actions.<br></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/VTQbCFIfzr4\"><img alt=\"sc diff 1.0\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pbewVcU.png\"></a></p>\n<p>Graphic made with <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911\">MediaKit</a>.</p>\n<h3>Disclaimer</h3>\n<p><strong>sc diff may crash if comparing shortcuts that both have a large number* of actions. This is unavoidable and due to limitations of the software (Shortcuts) and/or hardware (iPhone). I'm hoping that future efforts to optimize sc diff will resolve this issue, but there are no guarantees.</strong><br>\n*<em>Please Note: Number will fluctuate based on the amount of RAM available on your device at runtime.)</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.3.1 - Aug. 26, 2022, 7:47 p.m.</strong></p><p>â€¢ Expanded actions dictionary now includes actions from nearly every app that works with Shortcuts.
