Due to the way UsageKit works, it will have next to no impact on your performance.</p>\n<h3>Multi-Device Support</h3>\n<p>If you use more than once device, UsageKit will only show you statistics for the device you’re currently using.</p>\n<h3>Simple Design</h3>\n<p>UsageKit features a simple, data fuelled interface that keeps the important information at your fingertips. When you run UsageKit you will be greeted by a list of supported Shortcuts and the number of times you’ve run it. When you make a selection you will be presented with more detailed information about the statistics that Shortcut is monitoring. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshots\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gCIQziL.jpg\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Documentation</h1>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>Below you will find detailed instructions on both the basic and advanced implementation of UsageKit. The basic version will only require 4 Actions from you, and the advanced version will use a minimum of 5 Actions. To see this in action, use the <strong><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2116\">DEMO</a></strong> provided.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you experience any issues or require assistance, don’t hesitate to contact me via Reddit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/chat/user_id/t2_nrfeh\"><img alt=\"Message\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LwWAfMl.png\"></a></p>\n<h3>Basic Input (required)</h3>\n<p>The basic implementation of UsageKit only requires 4 Actions, this particular method is only used for 1 input and is required at least once in every Shortcut.</p>\n<p>To get started, place a <strong>”Get My Shortcuts Action”</strong> and add an <strong>”If Action”</strong> after it. Set the If Action input to <strong>”Contains”</strong> and enter <strong>”UsageKit”</strong> into the Value.</p>\n<p>Next, place a <strong>”Text Action”</strong> and paste the text from the template below into the box. </p>\n<pre><code>Shortcut Name\n\nTimes Run\n\n{{NUM}}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>First Line:</strong> The first line should contain the name of your Shortcut and should match the name that is in your Shortcut Library.</p>\n<p><strong>Second Line:</strong> Leave this blank.</p>\n<p><strong>Third Line:</strong> The third line will be the name of the statistic. For example, if your Shortcut is tracking downloads, you would set your statistic name to “Downloads”.</p>\n<p><strong>Fourth Line:</strong> Leave this blank.</p>\n<p><strong>Fifth Line:</strong> The fifth line will be used to display your Shortcut satistics and must include <strong>“{{NUM}}”</strong> (you may place any text around this). For example, if your Shortcut is tracking downloads, your your last line will read <code>{{NUM}} items</code>.</p>\n<p>And to finally finish the basic implimention, add a <strong>”Run Shortcut Action”</strong> at the end and link it to UsageKit. </p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is required that you use the template above at least once near the beginning of your Shortcut. This will be used to calculate the total times you run a Shortcut and is needed for the main menu.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Basic\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9I4yWMi.png\"></p>\n<h3>Advanced Input</h3>\n<p>The advanced implementation of UsageKit requires a minimum 5 Actions, this particular method is only used to send multiple statistics to UsageKit at once.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"1\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6mtHn4H.png\"></p>\n<p>To get started, place a <strong>”Text Action”</strong> and enter the required information (see basic input). Then add a <strong>Add to Variable Action”</strong> and enter <strong>”UsageKit”</strong> into the name (you can repeat this as many times as you like throughout the Shortcut).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"2\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4ek285i.png\"></p>\n<p>Near the end of your Shorcut, place a <strong>”Get My Shortcuts Action”</strong> and add an <strong>”If Action”</strong> after it. Set the If Action input to <strong>”Contains”</strong> and enter <strong>”UsageKit”</strong> into the Value.</p>\n<p>Finally, add a <strong>”Get Variable Action”</strong> linking to the variable we created and place a <strong>”Run Shortcut Action”</strong> at the end and link it to UsageKit. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"3\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7d61Xfj.png\"></p>\n<h3>Branding</h3>\n<p>If you feel UsageKit is the right fit for you and your Shortcuts, you may use the following on your RoutineHub page.</p>\n<p><code>[![UsageKit](https://i.imgur.com/LfJufxJ.png)](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2114)</code></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2114\"><img alt=\"UsageKit\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LfJufxJ.png\"></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.1 - Feb. 26, 2019, 10:44 a.m.</strong></p>"}
