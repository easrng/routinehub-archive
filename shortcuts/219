When I have permission, I’ll publish the “add-ins” that others have done the heavy lifting in helping create my ‘vision’. \n So, in order for this to be most effective, you will need to have your most frequent destinations saved as contacts, complete with address. And make a calendar with your work schedules and appointments.\nThen I believe it truly becomes useful.</p>\n<p>To start:\nActivate with Siri or widget.\nIt will check the the time of day for sunrise or sunset and adjust the brightness of your screen accordingly,\nit will first check your calendar to see if you have a calendar event with a location(ie-work, dentist appointment, etc.) if so, then plots your route via Waze, and starts selected playlist.\nIf no calendar event w/ location is found, will then check your location to see if you’re at work, if so, then assumes you’re on your way home, reads you reminders for when you get home, plots route, plays music.\nIf none of the above is true, Siri will ask “where to?”\nSo long as your response contains the key words or names, it will then open up navigation with Waze to the address of your response. And start a preselected playlist.\nExample: if I respond with ‘Mom’ or ‘My Walmart’, it will look for that in my contacts and plot a route. With music.\n If no contact found, will then open Waze and try your response as a Waze Favorite. With music of course.</p>\n<p>If questions, I’m on Reddit shortcuts u/jgibbs347</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>4.0 - Feb. 2, 2019, 11:07 a.m.</strong></p><p>Now when you activate with Siri, it will first check your calendar to see if you have a calendar event with a location(ie-work, dentist appointment, etc.) if so, then plots your route via Waze, and starts selected playlist.<br>If no calendar event w/ location is found, will then check your location to see if you’re at work, if so, then assumes you’re on your way home, reads you reminders for when you get home, plots route, plays music.<br>If none of the above is true, the shortcut will then ask you “where to?” Then checks contacts with your response(ie-Mom, or My Walmart) and plots route with music.
