It will be updated shortly the official release of these updates. You can try to use it on the betas, but it is not guaranteed to work.</h3><br>\n<p>By downloading, you accept the terms of use, as described at the bottom of this description.</p><br>\n<h4>Say goodbye to the Music app and your Apple Music subscription.</h4>\n<p>This shortcut allows you to play and store audio files, and convert them to other formats. You can put a song on loop, play it once, or convert it to aiff or m4a.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Music app, which requires you to buy a song if you want to play it with the Music app, you can play any sound file you can obtain. If you wrote a song yourself, but it's not on Apple Music, you can install MyTunes to listen to it with ease. If you are a customer of an artist who doesn't like to use Apple Music but sent you the file, you can easily play it with MyTunes. If you already bought a song some other way, you can play it in MyTunes.</p>\n<p>Playlists allow you to make a selection of songs, orgainize it however you want, and play it whenever you want.</p>\n<br>\n<h5>Integrations (Optional)</h5>\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://www.mikebeas.com/updatekit/\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eRc2mfq.png\"></a><br><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2692\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qEYvcF0.png\"></a></blockquote><br>\n<h5>Terms of Use</h5>\n<blockquote>\n<li>Do not redistribute, modify, or remix this shortcut without my permission.</li>\n<li>Do not copy any portion of the code.</li>\n<li>The Developer is not responsible for any misuse or abuse of this shortcut.</li>\n<li>You accept that these terms may change at any time.</li></blockquote><br>\n<h3>Thanks for keeping up to date with the official version of MyTunes.</h3>\n<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8YhmKCC.png\"></a><p></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0042 - Jan. 26, 2021, 5:17 p.m.</strong></p><p>Fixed a bug where renaming a playlist would save the playlist as a string instead of a dictionary</p>"}
