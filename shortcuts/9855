From cat bands, to sports fails, and award show blunders — Is there even a point in hitting send if there isn’t a hilarious looping image attached? I’d argue not. Whether you’re new to GIFs or consider yourself a connoisseur of the highest caliber, this shortcut is a must-have if you want to take your conversations and GIFs to the next level!</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Notable Features</h1>\n<p>• Shortcut Input Detection checks to see based on file extension, if a GIF is copied to your device's clipboard or not. This can be enabled/disabled via the shortcut settings menu or during initial shortcut set-up.</p>\n<p>• First ever shortcut to retrieve and extract a GIF’s <strong>{GIF}.UnclampedDelayTime</strong> value from media input metadata in order to retain and retrieve the exact speed of a selected GIF used for editing.</p>\n<p>• Adjust the speed of a GIF, and reset it if you want! Resetting the speed of a GIF will retrieve the original <strong>{GIF}.UnclampedDelayTime</strong> value from media input metadata of the GIF and set it back to that.</p>\n<p>• Resize a GIF’s pixel density either by Height or Width.</p>\n<p>• Apply Instagram-like filters to GIFs via EZGIF!\n<strong>Check out “Color Effects, Presets &amp; Filters” menu for more!</strong></p>\n<p>• Store a GIF to retrieve at a later time for up to an hour for “Color Effects, Presets &amp; Filters”.</p>\n<p>And many more features waiting underneath!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>They say a picture (or even a GIF) is worth a thousand words. So here’s alot that are self explanatory of what this shortcut is bringing forth.
