With this shortcut, you have to type those only once - the first time the shortcut is run: in this respect, it's no different from a standard Mac app that prompts for user input during the initialization to function correctly later. It saves all the data to a text file residing in a sub-folder of Shortcuts' folder of iCloud Drive*. It then gets the required information from this file on subsequent runs.\nYou can incorporate it into your shortcuts as a plugin via the \"Run Shortcut\" action or tweak it to your liking.\nCare about stdin and stdout, not dull little things. </p>\n<p>*For the file saving action Apple didn't provide other options than saving to iCloud Drive or Dropbox. This, in turn, implies that for the shortcut to work you must have iCloud Drive enabled.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.34 - May 19, 2021, 2:01 p.m.</strong></p><p>Small correction for an action that now counts words not characters of the shell command output and upon which rests the output (shows or not the result depending on whether it's text or an action).</p>"}
