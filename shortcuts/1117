It needs to be able to import mutliple files at a time to some kind of inbox. I recommend <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/panels-comic-reader/id1236567663?l=en&amp;mt=8\">Panels</a>. It's actively developed, has many nice features for reading manga and can import all downloaded cbz files directly.

There's a new option in the download menu where you can choose to download new chapters that were added since your last successful download of that series. You can also update multiple manga at a time by running the shortcut and leaving the search field empty. This will show you a list of all the manga you've downloaded so far. You can then select the ones you want to check for new chapters. To make these new features possible, MangaDL will create a folder in your iCloud Shortcuts folder containing a text file which stores the required information.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>3.1 - Dec. 8, 2018, 6:48 p.m.</strong></p><p>update manga automatically or manually, option to disable cover options menu</p>"}
