This allows for multiple games to be played at the same time. The game can be exported as a QR code, a note, or a text file in the ShareSheet which can be emailed. \n•Easy import! Scanning the saved QR code or clicking the link in the saved note will replace your current saved session with the saved session.</p>\n<p>Note that, while not required to use this, Toolbox Pro enables one additional feature when exporting QR codes. It allows a caption with a game name to be added to the photo. When installing the shortcut you will be prompted to enter YES or NO which will enable/disable that feature accordingly.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.3 - May 4, 2021, 3:17 p.m.</strong></p><p>Squashed a bug creating a folder to keep the JSON file in, thanks to community feedback!</p>"}
