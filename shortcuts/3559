UltraUpdate not only lets you Check For Updates where your shortcut is running, but also lets you Check For Updates on all of your shortcuts. By zachary7829.</p>\n<h2>For Developers &amp; Users:</h2>\n\n<h4>Based off of QuickUpdate</h4>\n\n<p>You want the best speed possible with an Updater. That’s why UltraUpdate is based of QuickUpdate, to ensure speed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Checks For Updates for itself</h4>\n\n<p>When UltraUpdate Checks for updates for your shortcut, it also checks for updates for itself, so you can always be up to date.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Feature-Packed</h4>\n\n<p>UltraUpdate is packed with features, so not only can you enjoy Speed, but features as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Easy to Switch</h4>\n\n<p>It’s very easy to switch to UltraUpdate, since UltraUpdate has a built in data transfer to transfer data from Check For Updates and Swing Updater into UltraUpdate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Custom Themes</h4>\n\n<p>UltraUpdate supports custom themes, so you can choose how UltraUpdate will look for you. It’s your Updater. So, why not make it look unique?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Speed</h4>\n\n<p>UltraUpdate has less than 190 Actions! Check For Updates alone has 300+, and Swing Updater has 400+!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Support For One, Support For All.</h4>\n\n<p>By adding support, your users cannot only choose UltraUpdate, but also QuickUpdate &amp; QuickUpdateEX. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Multi-Decimal</h4>\n\n<p>QuickUpdateEX, QuickUpdate, and UltraUpdate all support multi-decimal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Worded Versions</h4>\n\n<p>Thanks to 0Masking, QuickUpdateEX, QuickUpdate, and UltraUpdate all have the ability to use worded versions. QuickUpdate &amp; UltraUpdate are the first updaters to support this, and (currently), the only updaters that support it.\n</p><h2>Q/A:</h2>\n&nbsp;<p></p>\n<h4>How do I add support?</h4>\n\n<p>It’s easy - just have these actions:</p>\n<p>Create Folder (UltraUpdate/Updated) </p>\n\n<p>Create a dictionary with <strong>Current Version</strong>, <strong>RoutineHub ID</strong>, and <strong>Shortcut Name</strong> in your dictionary!</p>\n\n<p>Save File as (UltraUpdate/Updated/(RoutineHub ID).json</p>\n\n<p>(Note: Make sure the save file action saves the dictionary, and replace “(RoutineHub ID)” with your shortcut’s RoutineHub ID)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>You said this was coming back in July! What happened?</h4>\n\n<p>I spent most of my time working on other shortcuts then.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>What iOS version is UltraUpdate for?</h4>\n\n<p>UltraUpdate works for any device that runs iOS 13 or 14!\n</p><h2>Credits</h2>\n@D3W10 - For use of his vCard Menu Creator Shortcut<p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@pfg - For The Original Idea of Check For Updates</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@D3W10 Again - For the first one to create a successful and working combo of an Updater, and a Checking-Updater.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@dastefster - For suggesting the idea of the shortcut name being displayed when Checking updates for all shortcuts.</p>\n<h3>Beta and Bug Testing Server</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://discord.gg/GvGnWyG\">Join the Discord Server to test Betas and report bugs of my shortcuts!</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>Halloween Edition 2020 - Oct. 31, 2020, 11:06 p.m.</strong></p><p>Happy Halloween!
