Basically how it works is you choose attacking or defending and it will choose an operator and their loadout. </p>\n<p>When reading the result, you’re moving left to right, so one is on the left and 2 is on the right. If you get the occasional operator with 3 primary’s, 3 is on the right and 2 is the middle. </p>\n<p>This shortcut is not to be uploaded, edited, or tampered with in an(y) efforts to personalize or make your own, without express permission from the creator.
