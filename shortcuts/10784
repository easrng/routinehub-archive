If both are true then a greeting text is sent. The reason for the tag is you may want to store a contact’s birthdate but not send them an automated birthday greeting.\nAlso, if a contact has a nickname, it will use that as their name (useful for “dad” and “mom”).</p>\n<p>STEP 1:\nAdd birth dates to contacts. If year is unknown, choose 1900. It will break if “-“ is chosen for year.</p>\n<p>STEP 2:\nAdd tag to notes field if the contact should receive a greeting.</p>\n<p>STEP 3:\nSet up automation to run shortcut daily.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.01 - Jan. 3, 2022, 5:50 a.m.</strong></p><p>Updated comments in code and the ability to customize the birthday automation tag when first adding the shortcut.</p>"}
