{"id":"1368","name":"Nintendo eShop (AU) Link Opener","tagline":"This shortcut takes the NSUID code from Nintendo eShop (UK) pages and opens the equivalent AU page","icon":"ios12 c2071128575 g59742","latest":"3680","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Nintendo Australia doesn't currently have a storefront for purchasing eShop games. However, if you can find the direct links for each game, it does host the game pages from which you can purchase the game in a web browser and have it download remotely to your console.</p>\n<p>The direct game links in the Australian store are based on the game's NSUID code.</p>\n<p>This shortcut finds that code on the equivalent UK eShop page, and appends it to the Australian eShop game URL. This allows you to purchase the game in the Australian eShop from a web browser.</p>\n<p>If you are an Australian user of Deku Deals you know that the eShop links open in the UK eShop. This shortcut makes it much easier to purchase games via Deku Deals, which is why I focussed on getting it to work with UK eShop links.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Dec. 29, 2018, 1:43 a.m.</strong></p>"}
