In many cases, RSYNCdrop works faster and more reliably than airdrop. RSYNCdrop should also work on Windows devices.</p>\n<p>RSYNCdrop saves a file to the iCloud Drive, which is then 'rsynced' to a destination folder. This obviously requires root access and ssh, which are given on jailbroken devices. Once transfer is complete, the shortcut deletes the file from iCloud Drive.</p>\n<p>You NEED to set up a shared SSH key between the devices in order for it to work, as I couldn't find a way to bypass the SSH password otherwise. My other shortcut, RSYNCdrop 2, uses sshpass, but it stops working after a while for some unspecified reason. </p>\n<p>To set up the sharedd SSH key, Use this link (http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html). The host device should be your iDevice.</p>\n<p>The shortcut is best used when attached to the share sheet.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Tested on iOS 13/14, checkra1n and Unc0ver.\nIf you get the error saying that SSH could not connect, check your host password and port.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>0.1 - March 3, 2021, 12:13 a.m.</strong></p>"}
