You will be notified this way of an update available as well as the changes included in the update. </p>\n<p>As of v1.22, there is a file converter to adapt the older text files for storing state data into JSON format (for optimized charting). There is also a new file optimizer that will clean up unnecessary date entries (if there are date/time stamps in sequence with the same count of cases, it will keep the latest one). </p>\n<p>Shoutout to:\n* u/Crunchewy from Reddit/Discord for the inspiration for this\n* ROP for MediaKit Banners used for this page</p>\n<p>Below are examples of what the shortcut looks like as of the latest version\nNote: File Optimizer is dependent on your files having been converted to JSON already</p>\n<h4>Main Menu</h4>\n<p><img alt=\"new\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GOwVgz7.jpg\"></p>\n<h4>Main Menu with Update Available</h4>\n<p><img alt=\"new\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eH4nHtW.jpg\"></p>\n<h4>State Chooser and Summary</h4>\n<p><img alt=\"new\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/c4XSc7G.jpg\"></p>\n<h4>Secondary Menu (with charting option depending on settings)</h4>\n<p><img alt=\"new\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/y797l8U.jpg\"></p>\n<h4>Charting!</h4>\n<p>Time based x-axis that auto scales over time\n<img alt=\"newch\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/llOAwsF.png\"></p>\n<p>More updates will come in the future for various fixes (if needed).
