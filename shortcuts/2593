You simply need to input the name of your future Shortcut and the template does its thing!</p>\n<p>What happens?</p>\n<p>The Shortcut checks to see if your Shortcut has an app in the users iCloud, if it does, great, it’ll skip on to running your Shortcut. If not, it will grab the name of your Shortcut and create a folder in the users iCloud with a configuration file in it, which can be used by your Shortcut. </p>\n<p>After running your Shortcut it will automatically check for updates using UpdateKit if the user has it installed. If they don’t it will ask them if they would like to install it and if they select yes they’ll be taken to the UpdateKit install page. If they select no, they will not be prompted to install UpdateKit in the future. </p>\n<p>The only thing you need to do is tell the Shortcut what the name of your Shortcut will be, provide the current version number and the RoutineHub ID. Oh, and change the name of the Shortcut to yours. That’s it! </p>\n<p>If you use this template please leave the first comment at the top of the Shortcut as credit to me. Thank you.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - May 6, 2019, 3:52 a.m.</strong></p><p>Changed the way UpdateKit is located.</p>"}
