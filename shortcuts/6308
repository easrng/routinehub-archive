{"id":"6308","name":"Mix Chris by Christine and the Queens","tagline":"This shortcut plays Chris by Christine and the Queens with the language randomized per song.","icon":"ios14 c4274264319 g59832","latest":"21256","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Chris</em> by Christine and the Queens is an (excellent) album in which almost every song has a separate English and French version. But instead of listening to the album twice in a row, or listening just to one version, this shortcut mixes them together. For each song, it generates a random 1 or 2, and uses that to decide if the next song will be in French or English. This way, you never know what language you’ll hear until the vocals begin (unless you peek, of course).</p>\n<p>There are three songs in <em>Chris</em> that don’t have translated counterparts. This shortcut randomly selects one of nine outcomes for those songs, where it’ll play either the French pair in order, just the English one, all three, or one French and one English. That may sound confusing, but basically, it does it the way it should.</p>\n<p>Not tested on iOS 13 or 12, but it probably works on those versions as well.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2.0.1 - Sept. 28, 2020, 7:58 p.m.</strong></p><p>In 2.0.1: Bug fix for the updater - won’t tell you there’s an update when there isn’t one. Sorry!<br>In 2.0: No more bugs. Remade from scratch. Much faster. Just 50 actions — and half of those are just to check for updates! It works like a charm, every time. <br>I was able to do this because I learned how to use Repeat actions, Dictionaries, and Arrays within Dictionaries. <br>And for whatever reason, that fixed that annoying bug where the last song wouldn’t get added. And that part wasn’t even my fault, it’s an iOS bug.<br>I intend to make a shortcut based on this one for Chaleur Humaine/Christine and the Queens.</p>"}
