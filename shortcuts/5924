In this game you can join with a unique username, chat with other users, and explore the world around you! </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>How can I make my own games like this?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More details will be provided with the release of the framework but suffice to say your game world is built in one single large JSON file, and each time the player interacts with the world they retrieve the latest version of this JSON giving the game real-time updates. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Can I beta test your framework?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As of now, I have enough beta testers for now, but this might change in the future. If you’d like to be notified when I ask for testers join the r/shortcuts discord server because I’ll post there!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Can I make </em><em>X</em><em> in this framework?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You sure can! It might require a few modifications to your shortcut to support it but anything is possible! If you’d like help implementing X game just ping me on the r/shortcuts discord server!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>I found a bug!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's too bad! Please ping me in the r/shortcuts discord server and I’ll post an update soon!</p>\n<h1>Configuration:</h1>\n<p>To configure this shortcut and join the game, please enter your desired username when shortcuts prompts you. Please don't include expletives or profanities in your username, or your account will be deleted. I have an automation that purges undesirable words from the database every night at 12:00am.</p>\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this! If you have any questions not answered in WWSC or here ping me in the r/shortcuts discord server.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.4 - Sept. 24, 2020, 5:11 p.m.</strong></p><p>1.4 UPDATE.<br><br>What’s new in this version?<br>• more inclusive via translations<br>• minor speed boosts<br><br>64 actions</p>"}
