It’s free to register for a key and it allows you to do 50 calls/day, which is plenty in terms of looking up movie showtimes.

ShowtimeCuts was originally comprised of four separate modules, but after reviewing his App Framework tutorial, I was able to consolidate everything into one shortcut while creating the flexibility to add more features. I highly recommend it.</p>\n<p>I plan to fix any existing bugs as well as add additional features. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please let me know.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1.4 - March 30, 2019, 2:33 p.m.</strong></p><p>Bug fixes</p>"}
