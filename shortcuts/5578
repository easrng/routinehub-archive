This issue is not unique to <strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> and has been <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/\">reported to Apple</a>. Note also that the consequences of this adverse behavior can be mitigated by using the <strong>Priority Notes</strong> configuration parameter. See <strong>Shortcut Configuration</strong> below for more information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All other features of <strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> are working as expected.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p><strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> is a versatile shortcut that can be used to create and update iOS <em>ï£¿Notes</em> or any other iOS application that uses <em>text</em>. It is particularly useful for creating consistently formatted time-stamped logs/lists. This help includes seven possible uses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Dictate and create a quick note</em></li>\n<li><em>Append to a bulleted list</em></li>\n<li><em>Insert an annotated URL into a favorite list (using Safari)</em></li>\n<li><em>Share the Clipboard and a YouTube video using Messages</em></li>\n<li><em>Save links to interesting iOS applications</em></li>\n<li><em>Convert a PDF to a note</em></li>\n<li><em>Save a link from a third-party application</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> was designed to do its tasks quickly and with minimal shortcut interaction. It can be customized with several <em>Configuration Parameters</em>, described at the end of this help.</p>\n<p><em>A video overview of <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5578\">ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</a> is available <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5PEwdyatL4KTG7w2FPATF0r7P3DMjcD3\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p><strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> can assist in the <em>creation</em> (or <em>prependation</em> or <em>appendation</em>) of a note in the iOS <em>ï£¿Notes</em> app or text in the iOS <em>Clipboard</em> which can then be optionally shared with an other iOS app that uses text.</p>\n<p>As the shortcut runs, it constructs text that includes the following optional elements:</p>\n<p>[Start of Prefix<em>][Current Date] [Current Time][, Note Author</em>]\n[Dictated Text]\n[Shortcut Input**]</p>\n<p>* When the shortcut runs, the <strong>Start of Prefix</strong> can be specified from the <em>main menu</em> or by speaking a dictionary key at the beginning of the dictated text. That <strong>Start of Prefix</strong> DICTIONARY and the <strong>Note Author</strong> are defined during initial shortcut configuration or later by using <strong>Details</strong> &gt; <strong>Customize Shortcut</strong> or by manually changing actions in the <strong>Configuration Parameters</strong> section of this shortcut. All other text elements shown above are set during shortcut execution.</p>\n<p>** If the shortcut is started from the iOS <em>Share Sheet</em>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Example Usages</h3>\n<p>The versatility and configurability of this shortcut is most easily described using examples. This section is not exhaustive, but does demonstrate several possible uses of <strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Example 1 -- <em>Dictate and create a quick note</em></h4>\n<p>The <em>main menu</em> is normally used to select the note prefix. The menu <strong>Date</strong> and <strong>Time</strong> are dynamic and the <strong>Author</strong> reflects the configured name. Once the prefix is selected, the <em>Dictate text</em> screen appears. The red square is used to stop capturing <em>optional</em> speech.</p>\n<p>Note: The <em>dictation quick reference</em> at the top of the man menu will be discussed in subsequent examples.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qBbPBS7.png\"></p>\n<p>In this example, the <strong>Start of Prefix</strong> was not changed, thus the default value, twenty dashes{newline}*, is used and indicated at the top of the <em>action menu</em>. In this case, <strong>New ï£¿Note â€¢ â’¯</strong> is selected, thus the generated text is inserted into a new note in the iOS <em>ï£¿Notes</em> app. The text is placed on the second line so that the title can be manually added by the user.</p>\n<p>* The <strong>Start of Prefix</strong> options and other values can be changed via shortcut <strong>Configuration Parameters</strong>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qa2ytUQ.png\"></p>\n<h4>Example 2 -- <em>Append to a bulleted list</em></h4>\n<p>In this example, the <strong>Start of Prefix</strong> needs to be changed to a â€¢{space}. The <strong>Start of Prefix DICTIONARY</strong> can be accessed from the <em>main menu</em>. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8hTVMIO.png\"></p>\n<p>Once the <strong>Start of Prefix</strong> selection is made, the <em>main menu</em> reappears. In this example, no <em>Date/Time/Author</em> prefix is needed.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZyImfq0.png\"></p>\n<p>Occasionally when using <em>Dictate text</em>, the speech is incorrectly captured. To correct this issue <strong>$.</strong> can be used to effectively restart the dictation process: say <em>dollar sign period</em> </p>\n<p>Note: The top of the <em>main menu</em> (above) includes <em>dictation quick reference</em>. <em>$. Rstr</em> used in this example is indicated along with other items that will be discussed in subsequent examples.</p>\n<p>The red square is used to stop capturing speech and continue to display the <em>action menu</em> that includes the <strong>Select ï£¿Note â€¢ ðŸ…½ â’¯</strong> option.</p>\n<p>Note: <em>Blah blah blah</em> was spoken in this example for $. demonstration only. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/aTfS7uV.png\"></p>\n<p>After selecting one of the existing notes, the new text, <em>â€¢ A new bullet</em>, is appended and the updated note is displayed.</p>\n<p>Note: The notes that appear at the top of the <strong>Choose</strong> list include a ðŸ“Œ, <strong>Log</strong>, or <strong>List</strong> in the name. This is because these have been set as <em>Priority Notes</em> during the shortcut configuration. Refer to the final section of this help for more information. If a target note does not appear at the top of the list, the list can be scrolled or the <em>Search</em> filed can be used to locate the note.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5NLt3FJ.png\"></p>\n<h4>Example 3 -- <em>Insert an annotated URL into a favorite list (using Safari)</em></h4>\n<p>In this example, <strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> is started from <em>Safari</em> using the <em>Share Sheet</em>. </p>\n<p>Note: Below in the <em>Share Sheet</em>, <strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> appears just after <strong>Copy</strong>. This was changed by modifying the order of the actions using <strong>Edit Actions...</strong> that always appears at the bottom of the <em>Share Sheet</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/O4ko6FX.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Once a <em>prefix</em> option is selected from the <strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> <em>main menu</em>, <em>Dictate text</em> appears. In this example, an alternative method of specifying the <strong>Start of Prefix</strong> is demonstrated. (In the example above, the <em>main menu</em> was used.) This is done by speaking the <strong>Start of Prefix</strong> DICTIONARY Key followed by a period as indicated in <em>dictation quick reference</em> at the top of the <em>main menu</em>: <em>/n. SoP</em></p>\n<p>To summarize, in this example, the following was spoken before tapping the red square: <em>slash zero period micah 6 colon 8</em></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9qUa9eZ.png\"></p>\n<p>Since the <strong>Safari</strong> <em>Share Sheet</em> was used, the URL passed via the <em>Shortcut Input</em> is shortened and presented as an alternative to the <em>Native URL</em>. After selection, the <em>URL choice</em> and the <em>dictated text</em> are reflected at the top of the <em>action menu</em>. Then one of the <em>Clipboard</em> options*, <strong>Replace</strong>:â’¯ â‡¢ âŒ˜ðŸ„² / <strong>Prepend</strong>:â’¯ ðŸ…²ðŸ…± â‡¢ âŒ˜ðŸ„² / <strong>Append</strong>:ðŸ…²ðŸ…± â’¯ â‡¢ âŒ˜ðŸ„², combined with <strong>Select ï£¿Note</strong>, could be used to <em>insert</em> the text generated by this shortcut. In this example, <strong>â’¯ â‡¢ âŒ˜ðŸ„² â€¢ Select ï£¿Note</strong> is selected.</p>\n<p>* The iOS <em>Shortcuts</em> app does not include an action to <em>prepend</em> text into an existing note; <em>Create Note</em> and <em>Append to Note</em> are the only actions provided. Thus to <em>prepend</em> or <em>insert</em> text, the iOS <em>Clipboard</em> must be employed.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7ziDZmF.png\"></p>\n<p>The shortcut generated text, <em>dictated text</em> + <em>information passed via the Share Sheet (shortened)</em>, is used to <em>update</em> the <em>Clipboard</em>. When one of the existing notes is selected, it will be opened but not automatically changed.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3zIMEox.png\"></p>\n<p>The text generated by this shortcut and used to update the iOS <em>Clipboard</em> can be inserted using normal iOS <em>ï£¿Notes</em> app editing actions.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jiArbNB.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/G1OU9yL.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/d6BgpxN.jpg\"></p>\n<h4>Example 4 -- <em>Share the Clipboard and a YouTube video using Messages</em></h4>\n<p>In this example, a URL for a video in the <em>YouTube</em> app will be appended to the contents of the iOS <em>Clipboard</em>. The resulting text will be shared using the iOS <em>Messages</em> app.</p>\n<p>To start, within the <em>YouTube</em> app the <em>Share</em> button is tapped and the <em>YouTube</em> app <em>Share</em> dialog opens. Additional <em>Share</em> options are visible by dragging to the left.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ItXILK1.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Tapping the <em>More (...)</em> button displays the standard iOS <em>Share Sheet</em>. Here <strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> can be started and the <em>YouTube</em> URL will be passed via the <em>Shortcut Input</em>. </p>\n<p>Note: In this example <strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> appears just after <strong>Copy</strong>. This was changed by modifying the order of the actions using <strong>Edit Actions...</strong> that always appears at the bottom of the <em>Share Sheet</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/C0wMeUi.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>Date Time</strong> will be added to the text. In the <em>Dictate text</em> dialog <em>/0.</em> (speak <em>slash zero period</em>) selects the respective <strong>Start of Prefix</strong> value, NUL.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/93pX4pL.png\"></p>\n<p>After selecting the <strong>Shortened URL</strong> from the <em>URL menu</em>, <strong>ðŸ…²ðŸ…± â’¯ â€¢ Share</strong> is selected to append the text, <strong>Start of Prefix</strong> (<em>NUL</em> in this case) + <strong>Date Time</strong> + <em>dictated text</em> + <strong>YouTube Shortened URL</strong>, to the contents of the iOS <em>Clipboard</em>.</p>\n<p>Note: With the last three actions, <strong>Share</strong>, <strong>Prepend to Clipboard â€¢ Share</strong>, <strong>ðŸ…²ðŸ…± â’¯ â€¢ Share</strong>, the contents of the <em>Clipboard</em> are <em>used</em> but the <em>Clipboard</em> itself is <em>not changed</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FFQjgYy.png\"></p>\n<p><em>Messages</em> is selected from the standard iOS <em>Share Sheet</em> and the text from the shortcut is automatically loaded.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XrQgSUw.jpg\"></p>\n<h4>Example 5 -- <em>Save links to interesting iOS applications</em></h4>\n<p>In this example, a link to an iOS app will be appended to a list of others. In addition, all of the items in the <em>dictation quick reference</em> (top of <em>main menu</em>) will be used to review how <em>Configuration Parameters</em> can be superseded using the <em>Dictate text</em> dialog.</p>\n<p>In this case, <strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> is started from the <em>App Store</em> <em>Share Sheet</em>.</p>\n<p>Note: Below in the <em>Share Sheet</em>, <strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> appears just after <strong>Copy Link</strong>. This was changed by modifying the order of the actions using <strong>Edit Actions...</strong> that always appears at the bottom of the <em>Share Sheet</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zTpihTK.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>Date</strong> is selected for the <strong>Date/Time/Author</strong> prefix. Although a bit contrived for demonstration, three different codes are used during <em>Dictate text</em>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>[ <strong>$.</strong> ] ignore preceding speech capture (used to <em>start over</em> when the <em>Dictate text</em> action occasionally misinterprets user speech)</li>\n<li>[ <strong>/7.</strong> ] use the <strong>Start of Prefix</strong> value corresponding to the <strong>/7</strong> Key</li>\n<li>[ <strong>-.</strong> ] shorten the URL (bypass the <em>Native/Shortened URL</em> menu)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: <em>Blah blah blah</em> was spoken in this example for $. demonstration only. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1rkBWFP.png\"></p>\n<p>The shortcut-generated text is indicated at the top of the <em>action menu</em> and <strong>Select ï£¿Note â€¢ ðŸ…½ â’¯</strong> is selected. Then the existing note, <strong>Interesting iOS Apps List</strong> is selected.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/h7lhx72.png\"></p>\n<p>Once the note is opened and the  text is appended, it can of course be be modified and/or supplemented as with any other note in the <em>ï£¿Notes</em> app.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NMKgcuV.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BGNT6f6.jpg\"></p>\n<h4>Example 6 -- <em>Convert a PDF to a Note</em></h4>\n<p>Leveraging the incredible power built into the <em>Shortcuts</em> app, this shortcut can even be used as a crude <em>PDF to text</em> conversion tool. In this case, a <em>Mail</em> message was saved as PDF to the <em>iCloud Drive</em>.</p>\n<p>Using the iOS <em>Files</em> app, the PDF is opened, and <strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> is started from the <em>Share Sheet</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/umpG8sW.jpg\"></p>\n<p>After starting <strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> from the <em>Share Sheet</em>, the <em>main menu</em> appears and the <em>prefix</em> selection is made.</p>\n<p>Note: Below in the <em>Share Sheet</em>, <strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> appears just after <strong>Copy</strong>. This was changed by modifying the order of the actions using <strong>Edit Actions...</strong> that always appears at the bottom of the <em>Share Sheet</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bWB15Ls.jpg\"></p>\n<p>To override the configured default <strong>Start of Prefix</strong>, <em>/0.</em> (<em>slash zero period</em>) is used. The spoken text and the first portion of the converted PDF then appears at the top of the <em>action menu</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4QPFfVa.png\"></p>\n<p>A new note opens and it can be modified and supplemented like any other note in the <em>ï£¿Notes</em> app. In this case a title is added. Note that the <em>ï£¿Notes</em> app automatically sets the title to bold text.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XBLRZbH.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oTcN3pw.jpg\"></p>\n<h4>Example 7 -- <em>Save a link from a third-party application</em></h4>\n<p>Any third-party app that can access the standard iOS <em>Share Sheet</em> can share information with <strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> via the <em>Shortcut Input</em>. Some applications pass more than one element. For example, the <em>Reeder</em> app, shown below, passes a <em>Article Title</em> as well as the <em>URL</em>.</p>\n<p>For the <strong>Reeder</strong> app, access to the standard iOS <em>Share Sheet</em> is done using the <em>More...</em> item. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oCKIkfF.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> is started and the <strong>Date</strong> prefix is selected.</p>\n<p>Note: In this example <strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> appears just after <strong>Copy</strong>. This was changed by modifying the order of the actions using <strong>Edit Actions...</strong> that always appears at the bottom of the <em>Share Sheet</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lBIisOY.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>$.</strong> is used to restart speech capture and <strong>/0.</strong> and <strong>-.</strong> were also spoken to supersede the default values for <strong>Start of Prefix</strong> and <strong>URL Form</strong>, two of the <strong>Configuration Parameters</strong>.</p>\n<p>* The <em>Dictate text</em> action will normally capture <em>slash zero period</em> speech as <strong>/0.</strong>; however, occasionally this speech will be captured as indicated below: <strong>/Zero.</strong> That is not a problem; either format will be properly interpreted by this shortcut.</p>\n<p>Note: <em>Blah blah blah</em> was spoken in this example for $. demonstration only. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/V1HDJZJ.png\"></p>\n<p>The <em>Reeder</em> app, supplied the <em>Article Title</em> (<em>AppStories, Episode 172...</em>) and the Native URL which was shortened by the shortcut. </p>\n<p>In this example, a note title, automatically bold, is manually entered.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oz4uWrU.jpg\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Shortcut Configuration</h3>\n<p><strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> can be configured when it is added to the shortcut Library or anytime after using <strong>Details</strong> &gt; <strong>Customize Shortcut...</strong>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yGNXlel.jpg\"></p>\n<p>When <strong>Customize Shortcut...</strong> is selected, the following <strong>ï£¿Notes &amp; Clipboard Assistant</strong> information is displayed. On this screen, there is nothing to configure. After scrolling and reading, click the blue <strong>Continue</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jDoiwCb.png\"></p>\n<p>The <strong>Start of Prefix DICTIONARY</strong> is the first configuration parameter. After reading, scrolling, and optional changes, click the blue <strong>Continue</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/45kWS6F.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Note Author</strong> and <strong>Include Prompt for Optional Dictation?</strong> are the next two configuration parameters. After each optional change, click the blue <strong>Continue</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dtNyg3p.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>URL Form</strong> and <strong>Suppress Notifications</strong> are the final configuration parameters. </p>\n<p>With <strong>URL Form</strong>, valid settings are <strong>+</strong>, <strong>-</strong>, <strong>?</strong>, or <strong>two integers</strong> separated by a <strong>|</strong>, e.g., <strong>50 | 150</strong>. In this case, when the <strong>Shortcut Input</strong> includes a URL: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>the <em>Native</em> URL will be used whenever it is 50 or fewer characters in length, </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the <em>Shortened</em> URL will be used whenever the Native URL is 150 or greater characters, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a menu will be presented with <em>Native</em> and <em>Shortened</em> as options when the <em>Native</em> URL is 51 to 149 characters.
