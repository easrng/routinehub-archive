It gets the link for each file and shortens it. Then it creates a formatted list of the names of each shortcut with the link to download it and copies it to your clipboard to be easily pasted anywhere. It then deletes this copy so the next list you make will be accurate. This does not effect any of the links you share.</p>\n<p><em>Keep in mind this process takes a bit if youâ€™re sharing all of your shortcuts and have a lot of them</em></p>\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Dependencies:</strong>\n<a href=\"http://www.mikebeas.com/updatekit/\">UpdateKit</a>,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2691\"><img alt=\"Requires TranslateKit\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/H8RJgxY.png\"></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1.4 - Jan. 21, 2020, 4:52 a.m.</strong></p><p>Fix version number</p>"}
