In my example, I created a MyHarmony activity which turns on my Apple TV, my Vizio TV and changes TV HDMI to the input which my Apple TV is connected. Now you can link your Harmony Hub to IFTTT, which then can be triggered by my Siri ShortCut. You do not need to be on the same WiFi network for this to work like some of the other ShortCuts.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to IFTTT.com and link the MyHarmony service to your account. Click on  the “Services” tab and search for “Harmony”. Click on “Connect” and sign in with your MyHarmony account.</li>\n<li>Now you’ll need to create an applet to trigger your MyHarmony activity. Click on the “Applets” tab then click “New Applet”.</li>\n<li>Click on “+this” within the “if +this then that link”.</li>\n<li>Search for “webhooks” and click on the webhooks icon.</li>\n<li>Choose trigger by clicking on the “Receive a web request” box.</li>\n<li>Create an event name (I use something like “turn_on_apple_tv”). Then click create trigger.</li>\n<li>Click on “+that” within the “if +this then that link”.</li>\n<li>Search for “harmony” and click on the harmony icon.</li>\n<li>Click on “Start activity” if you want to use this shortcut for turning Apple TV on, or choose “End activity” to use the shortcut for turning off the Apple TV.</li>\n<li>Under the Start/End activity box, you’ll select the MyHarmony activity you wish to run from the dropdown list and click “Create Action”.</li>\n<li>Use the toggle to enable/disable run notifications (I have mine off) then click on “Finish”.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now that you’ve linked your Harmony Hub to IFTTT and created your applet, you’ll need to get your webhooks key to paste into the Siri ShortCut before you run it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks and click on the “Documentation” button on the top right of the page.</li>\n<li>At the top of the next page you’ll see your webhooks key. This will be needed the first time you open the shortcut.</li>\n<li>Open the Siri ShortCut and you’ll be prompted for your webhooks key and IFTTT/Harmony trigger action phrase from #6 above.</li>\n<li>Customize the Siri phrase if you wish and that should be it, enjoy!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Find me on Twitter: @JasonC</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0.1 - Dec. 23, 2018, 8:01 a.m.</strong></p><p>Fixed Set up URL</p>"}
