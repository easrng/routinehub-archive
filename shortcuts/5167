To make resetting values easier I had to restructure the way <strong>Turnip Tracker</strong> stored the values. This means that the data in <strong>Data Jar</strong> is incompatible with the newest version. To fix this just hit <strong>Reset Week</strong> and the shortcut will reformate the dictionaries used. If you wish to save any inputted values. Go to <strong>DataJar</strong> (the app), Click <strong>Turnip</strong>, then <strong>values</strong>, and screenshot the numbers you want to keep.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>TLDR;</strong> If you had beta it won't work until you reset but you'll lose any entered data, read above to learn how to not lose it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Disclaimers</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>I am not the creator of   <a href=\"turnipprohet.io\">Turnip Prophet</a>.
