This shortcut is an example that makes use of this system in two ways: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>A specific action is performed the first time only the shortcut is run.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A variable stores information the user provided the first time for later use.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Use this system inside your own shortcuts, if necessary.</p>\n<p>(This system allows do-while-loops deep inside your shortcut for example. For more information on that see my „Do While Loop“ shortcut)</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Aug. 26, 2020, 10:32 p.m.</strong></p>"}
