I have found that these breaks help me to concentrate, to process the language and be aware of new phrases.</p>\n<p>In order to listen with AirPods while walking or running the shortcut repeatedly plays a silent sound file to keep it running with the phone/screen turned off. This works fairly well most of the time!</p>\n<p>Because the pauses occur at a fixed interval rather than respecting natural breaks after words and sentences a short “rewind” occurs to cover cut-off speech. This isn’t ideal but works well enough.</p>\n<p>If you want to try different timings make sure you duplicate the shortcut first. It’s very easy to upset the background running.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Jan. 3, 2021, 8:42 a.m.</strong></p>"}
