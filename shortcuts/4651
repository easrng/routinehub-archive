The site where the shortcut takes data is divided by zones, so your researches will be more detailed. iDetector currently supports 21 zones but more will be added soon. Feel free to request some zones.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h6>Important Notes</h6>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Some services aren't available on every zone's site.
