The text below is taken from my Reddit post.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a 3 second countdown sound instead of a delay.</li>\n<li>Added a little ding at the end.</li>\n<li>Set the camera to the higher quality back camera.</li>\n<li>Get current volume, then set volume to audible level (necessary to hear queues) then set volume back to what it was.</li>\n<li>Added \"Continue Shortcut in App\" to get around Shortcuts Siri bug. It should run from Siri.</li>\n<li>Added more border around vertical, horizontal, and grid prints. Looks more like a photo strip.</li>\n<li>Added a multi select/save feature to save multiple printed photos.</li>\n<li>Added Flashing lights as a timer queue!</li>\n<li>Combined some logic into repeat loops instead. Code is much simpler.</li>\n<li>Added a notification that photo strips are printing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Not sure why but after adding the white borders, the quick look at the end seems sluggish. If anyone resolves feel free to let me know.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - Nov. 8, 2018, 7:32 p.m.</strong></p><p>Removed unused volume setting prior to shutter. </p>"}
