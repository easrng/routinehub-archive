An update for iOS 14 is planned but will take as long as Apple is able to fix the numerous bugs of iOS 14, which also affect the Shortcuts app.</h4>\n<h5>Unfortunately, iOS 14 is one of the most disastrous operating system updates in recent years. There are hundreds of bugs that affect numerous areas (Apple Music, Mail, CarPlay, HomeKit, Shortcuts, Widgets, GPS, WiFi, Mobile Data and so on). And for this reason, I am not currently updating any of my devices to iOS 14.</h5>\n<h5>Apple was for example not able to fix the \"Show Web Page\" action bug of the Shortcuts app during the whole developer and public beta phase. Even with the official release of iOS 14 the bug is still not fixed. In all current betas of iOS 14, which were released after the official release, there is no fix for the bug either.</h5>\n<h5>So if you experience any issues using the shortcut, thank Apple. And of course, I'm sorry that you have to pay for Apple's bugs. But I don't see the point of investing time, temporarily rebuilding my shortcuts to work despite the bugs, only to undo everything again when the multi-billion dollar company Apple is able to do its job properly again.</h5>\n<h5>Thanks for your understanding.</h5>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img alt=\"Made for iOS 13\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kpoXlNs.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img alt=\"PDF Color Inversion Banner\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QopjYgk.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<p><img alt=\"PDF Color Inversion is 100% Malware Free\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3gZZqIZ.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;   </p>\n<h1>Welcome to<br>PDF Color Inversion</h1>\n<h2>This shortcut inverts the colors of a PDF file. For this purpose, the individual pages are extracted and converted into image files. In a further step, the colors of each page are inverted using JavaScript. Afterwards, all images/pages are converted back to PDF.</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<p><img alt=\"PDF Color Inversion\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xYCMW4y.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp; </p>\n<h2>How To</h2>\n<h3>The shortcut can be used via Share Sheet or directly in the Shortcuts App.</h3>\n<h3>1. Select a PDF file from iCloud Drive</h3>\n<h3>2. Now you can choose whether the whole PDF or only individual pages should be inverted.</h3>\n<h3>3. The shortcut now generates the inverted PDF. Please be patient. Depending on the number of pages it can take quite a long time until the color inversion is completed.  So please consider carefully if you really need all pages.</h3>\n<h3>4. The PDF can be saved in iCloud Drive or in your Dropbox in the last step.  Alternatively, you can share it and pass it on to other apps. If you choose \"Show PDF\", you will also have the option to save or share it afterwards.</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h2>Credits</h2>\n<p>The JavaScript code used in \"PDF Color Inversion\" is from \"<a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1629\">Invert Image</a>\" shortcut by @keveridge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;  </p>\n<h2>No third party Updater Shortcut required.</h2>\n<p><em>PDF Color Conversion</em> has an integrated update mechanism called <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/793\">Embed-a-Update</a>.
