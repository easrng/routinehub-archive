Hold volume down to confirm the action or hold volume up to cancel the action. Waiting ten seconds without doing either of these will also cancel the action.</p>\n<p>To use, simply run the shortcut with the text “confirm” (without quotes) passed as the input. It will return either “yes”, meaning they confirmed the action or “no”, meaning they canceled the action (neither have quotes).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/764f18111d6d4e14a6346389e4e6e9e4\">Example shortcut</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - April 13, 2019, 6:46 p.m.</strong></p><p>Fix for iPads/iPods and UpdateKit support</p>"}
