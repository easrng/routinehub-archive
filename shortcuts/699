Often, I can force-touch or long-tap on a link pointing somewhere and a share sheet or menu will appear showing me the URL with a couple actions. Other times, I get nothing. I end up force-touching/long-tapping, copying (if given the option), and then pasting whatever it is into the most accessible text field I can get. Too much work.</p>\n<p>With this Shortcut, force-touch or long-tap on a link and share it to this. A menu will appear showing the destination URL and giving you the options of opening the link in Safari or copying it to the clipboard. If the URL had been shortened, this Shortcut will expand it to us original form.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.0 - Nov. 3, 2018, 6:23 a.m.</strong></p>"}
