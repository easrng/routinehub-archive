When used from the share sheet, it will ask you what size you want the images resized to. Then it will resize the images, and you can choose to save them to Photos, or Files. If you select Photos, it will save them to the “Recents” album. If you select Files, you can choose what location in the Files app you would like to save them to.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>v1.5 - Jan. 16, 2021, 4:41 p.m.</strong></p><p>-Small tweaks and bug fixes</p>"}
