The code is made of four digits between 1 and 6. (Decide in advance whether repeated digits are allowed.)</p>\n<p>The codebreaker then has ten chances to guess the code correctly. After each attempt, feedback is generated automatically by the shortcut to give the codebreaker some clues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Red dot: correct digit in correct place</li>\n<li>White dot: correct digit in incorrect place</li>\n<li>Nothing: incorrect digit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The order of the dots does not correspond to their positions in the code, however. The codebreaker must take the number of dots of each color and make an educated guess as to which dot corresponds to each position in the code.</p>\n<p>If you guess the code correctly, you win! If not, then after ten attempts, you lose, and you will be able to see the correct code.</p>\n<p>Made in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/g4twrh/mastermind/\">collaboration</a> with <a href=\"/user/robric18\">@robric18</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>1.1 - June 28, 2021, 3:25 a.m.</strong></p><p>Disable decimals and negative numbers when prompting the user to enter a code.</p>"}
