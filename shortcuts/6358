It currently supports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Swing/Embed-a-Update</li>\n<li>Lightning/Quick/Speedy/Swing S + more</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Publish</h2>\n<p>Publishing can be a hassle, some shortcuts don't secure your API keys properly! Pill uses military grade encryption which secures your API so no one can access your account without your consent! It also requires no passwords, just a simple 'Create Link' button</p>\n<h2>Search</h2>\n<p>View RoutineHub without the ads and other clutter in a simple-to-navigate list of top shorcuts for your search term</p>\n<h2>Get Stats</h2>\n<p>Quickly view your stats to see how you're doing, it will show you Hearts &amp; Downloads. You can also view these stats on other shortcuts</p>\n\t\t\t\t","releasenotes":"<p><strong>2020.9 - Sept. 20, 2020, 3:08 a.m.</strong></p><p>Minor Bugfixes<br><br>Actions - 550<br>Published on - Sep 19, 2020<br>System Version - 14.0</p>"}
